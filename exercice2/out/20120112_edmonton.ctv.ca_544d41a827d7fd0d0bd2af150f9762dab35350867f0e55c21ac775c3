Study subjects lost up to eight pounds over a four-month period.While both patients with and without type 2 diabetes lost weight, the weight loss was more pronounced in patients without the disease."We see a sustained effect on body weight throughout the trials, 25 trials," researcher Dr. Tina Vilsboll, head of diabetes research at the University of Copenhagen, told CTV News. "So it is not just a coincidence, it is efficacious on body weight."The findings are especially significant because other diabetes medications often cause patients to gain, rather than lose, weight.The researchers write that further study is needed to determine if GLP-1, which costs about $400 per month, should be prescribed for overweight or obese patients without type 2 diabetes.According to Vilsboll, researchers will know within the next two to three years if GLP-1 can be more widely prescribed solely as weight-loss treatment.The study has led some experts to urge caution, however.In an accompanying editorial, obesity specialist Dr. Raj Padwal of the University of Alberta points out that the weight loss was modest.As well, the hormone can produce side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, and comes with a possible risk of damage to the pancreas and the thyroid."While these results highlight the weight-reducing benefits, they should not alter current practice," Padwal wrote.According to Padwal, "modification of diet and lifestyle remains the cornerstone of the treatment of type 2 diabetes."Vilsboll said the hormone is not a cure for type 2 diabetes. However, combined with lifestyle changes, it could have a major impact on the health of patients.Dr. Ravi Retnakaran of Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital is also studying the hormone, and says the research "is an encouraging sign because weight control is an important part of the management of diabetes."With a report from CTV medical specialist Avis Favaro and producer Elizabeth St. PhilipCTV NEWS VIDEO PLAYERTop StoriesMost PopularViewerCTV News: Gut hormone benefitsA new study finds giving overweight or obese patients a gut hormone that suppresses their appetite can also lead to weight loss, and reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
