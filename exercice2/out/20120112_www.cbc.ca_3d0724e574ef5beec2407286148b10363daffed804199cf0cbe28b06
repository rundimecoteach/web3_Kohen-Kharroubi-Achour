Calgary police showed this ecstasy Wednesday at a news conference.(CBC)Paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMMA) and methamphetamine were present in the lab results for each of the recent deaths, the chief medical examiner's office said.Officials believe each of the overdose victims thought they were taking straight ecstasy (MDMA).“This is a prime example of the gamble people take when they use illegal drugs,” said Calgary police drug unit staff Sgt. Mike Bossley.“You never know what is in your drug: yesterday, it was MDMA, today, it’s PMMA, and tomorrow, it could be something else. There is no safe street drug, and no safe dose of a street drug,” he said.Dr. Mark Yarema, medical director of the province’s Poison and Drug Information Service (PADIS), said while they can look similar, there are important differences between ecstasy and methamphetamine.“Although all have toxic effects, PMMA is considered more toxic than MDMA, with a higher incidence of seizures and elevated body temperature.”Methamphetamine can also be slower to act, prompting users to take several tablets to get the desired effect, he said.Police are still investigating the source of the drugs taken in each of the deaths. The names of the victims are not being released for privacy reasons.Share ToolsReport TypoSend FeedbackStay Connected with CBC NewsMobileFacebookPodcastsTwitterAlertsNewsletterBig Box AdvertisementLatest Calgary News HeadlinesNaheed Nenshi ready to take on Rob Ford in fitness fightCalgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi says he is ready to take on Toronto Mayor Rob Ford in a battle of the bulge.more »Environmentalists, residents protest Castle logging plansA few dozen environmentalists and local residents were on hand in the Castle Wilderness Area on Wednesday to protest logging plans for the area. more »Redford meets with Quebec Premier Jean CharestPremier Alison Redford was in Quebec Wednesday to meet with Premier Jean Charest in advance of the Council of the Federation meeting next week in Victoria. more »Viterra expects gains with end of wheat board monopolyAgriculture giant Viterra says it expects to benefit from the end of the Canadian Wheat Board's monopoly. more »New Keystone XL route almost readyTransCanada Corp., the Canadian company attempting to build a $7 billion pipeline to carry oil from Canada to refineries along the Gulf Coast, soon will have a new route that seeks to allay worries of U.S. regulators, a company executive said Wednesday. more »Most RecentWatchListenShow previous slideShow next slideShow previous slideShow next slideTop News HeadlinesSyria protests continue against defiant AssadAnti-government protesters rallied for another night on the outskirts of Damascus, hours after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad made a surprise appearance at a pro-regime rally in the city centre, where he again vowed to end the months-long revolt against his rule.more »Afghan president condemns U.S. marines urination videoAfghan President Hamid Karzai condemns a video depicting what appears to be four U.S. marines urinating on the corpses of Taliban fighters, calling the apparent actions "completely inhumane" and demanding that the U.S. military punish the marines. more »RCMP spied on Bob Rae in 1960sNewly declassified documents reveal the RCMP spied on Bob Rae during his student activist days and likely amassed a personal file on the future interim Liberal leader. more »Haiti's struggle to build better homes after quakeInnovative building technology is one hope for the future in Haiti, where more than 500,000 people still live in temporary camps two years after a devastating earthquake. more »U.K. spies won't face charges for Guantanamo tortureAgents working for Britain's spy agencies won't face criminal charges over their alleged complicity in the mistreatment of former Guantanamo detainees, the country's top prosecutor says. more »More Headlines »Most ViewedMost CommentedEcstasy laced with meth blamed in 5 Calgary deathsNaheed Nenshi ready to take on Rob Ford in fitness fightDriver charged in deadly weekend crashEnvironmentalists, residents protest Castle logging plansParoled child killer back behind barsAccused serial abuser brought to Alberta to face chargesRedford meets with Quebec Premier Jean CharestViterra expects gains with end of wheat board monopolyNew Keystone XL route almost readyFeatures »MapPaul Karchut's Ski ReportFind out what's happening with conditions as winter weather kicks into gearInteractiveCalgary Gas PricesWhere is the cheapest gas in Calgary?
