I couldn't be much worse off than I was," she said.Her friend, Nicola Rogers, accompanied her to the hospital from her apartment in Rathfarnham, Dublin, and by 6pm on Friday she was recovering from the four-hour operation."The kidney seemed to take straight away. The anaesthetic was not pleasant but as soon as I woke I instantly felt more alert," she said."The brain and everything is sluggish, you are slower to react on dialysis. It was like waking from a 100-year sleep."The fit young woman was shocked to learn in 2008 that she had a form of chronic kidney disease. By June 2009, her condition had begun to deteriorate and she had a tube inserted into her stomach to allow her perform DIY dialysis at home."That was the worst thing about it. It was there all the time and I really hated it," she said.Ms Hennelly last night said her thoughts were with the donor and their family."My donor is on my mind. I won't know who that person is or who they were but they gave me this great gift of life. It is so fantastic that people do that and can find the strength to do that," she said.To receive an organ donor card, freetext 'Donor' to 50050.- Louise HoganIrish IndependentDownload our iPhone App NowComments that are judged to be defamatory, abusive or tasteless will not be approved and contributors who consistently fall below these criteria will be permanently blacklisted.
