But still, the figure is likely to reach a massive 162,000 by the year 2020. The statements have been based on an estimate made after analyzing the General Practice Research Database. Apart from the increase stated above, the number of people suffering from motor neurone disease is expected to spike up by more than 27% during the same period.While expressing his views in this regard, the Chief Executive of Parkinson's UK, Steve Ford, said that the Government was in fact having had “it's head in the sand” and in addition to it, the demands for a "neurology tsar" for sorting out the entire scenario are gradually spiking up.The Neurological Alliance covers the responsibility of as many as 70 groups, and it was of the opinion that an amalgamation of cheap services and increasing number of cases was in fact causing fair amount of troublesome issues.It further took the bull by its horns, claiming that the NHS is not being able to fulfill its duties in this regard, while the government claimed that it is fully aware of whatever is going around in the region.The government assured that it is completely in the know that there is a dire need for doing something that can ensure people get the best of services and the perilous issues of life-threatening diseases like the Parkinson's disease can be curbed in the nick of time.The comments from the alliance narrowly tailed a report, released recently by the National Audit Office, which thoroughly condemned the standards of care being provided by the NHS.Login or register to post commentsPrintEmail to friendYou May Also Like..NJ Woman Delivers Baby Boy in...NHS Finding Hard to Deal with...Internet Addiction is...Education Can Deter Young...Brave Eleana Turns One- Year...Disparity in Cost of Patients...Novel Diabetic Jab Now...Internet Addiction Leads to...RCP Protests against NHS...Breastfeeding is the Best,...NHS Future Forum Warns HCAsNHS Hospitals Need to Spend...Must readsFeatured News»Breast Implant: They Need To Be Certainby Bilyana PetrinskaFeatured News»Anti-depressant Venlafaxine Can Relieve Hot...by Anna Tomova»Paramedics Still Suffering Hospital Abuse,...by Anna TomovaKhaled Smeida»Edmonton Doctor Suspended Over Sexual...by Bilyana PetrinskaInternet Addiction Leads to Mind ChangesFeatured News.A group of researchers has found that more than needed use of internet can bring alterations in the brains of adolescents who spend hours on it,...RCP Protests against NHS Health and Social Care BillUnited Kingdom.Recently a poll was being organized by the Royal College of General Practitioners which asked people that whether or not they support the Health...Breastfeeding is the Best, Say ResearchersFeatured News.A team of researchers at the Medical Research Council has found after a study that mothers should not be concerned while breastfeeding their...NHS Future Forum Warns HCAsUnited Kingdom.The NHS Future Forum, an independent advisory panel, has recently warned nurses and alleged them of having improper skills and knowledge in their...NHS Hospitals Need to Spend More on Food for PatientsSimon Burns.It has been recently revealed that a few NHS hospitals aren’t using their funds well and are not spending enough money on the food of the patients...Welsh Government to Pay for Breast Implant ReplacementsUnited Kingdom.It has been recently revealed by the Government of Wales that women who are currently living under the threat of contracting breast cancer,...Use of Aspirin Instigates Inner Hemorrhage, Say ScientistsFeatured News.It has been recommended by a team of scientists that the use of aspirin should be stopped so as to avoid its fatal effects in future.
