Jan 11, 2012 9:20 PM CSTOfficials in Saskatoon say their hospitals, including St. Paul's, are filled. (CBC)Officials in Saskatoon say they have brought in extra staff and are assigning overtime hours in an effort to cope with what they are calling an unprecedented surge in hospital patients."Saskatoon Health Region care providers in Saskatoon’s three hospitals are facing and addressing an extremely busy period, with a demand for inpatient beds that is not subsiding," officials said Wednesday.At a news conference, officials said they are used to dealing with a jump in patients during the holiday season, but this year has been busier than ever before and has lasted well into January."We have more patients than we're able to have room for with high capacity right now," Pam Molnar, a nursing manager at St. Paul's Hospital, said. "We just never had it for this extended period of time before."Molnar said no single illness accounts for the high volume.Officials said they are finding space wherever they can, with some day surgery and recovery room beds being used for the overflow.They say that while Saskatoon is a growing city, they are not sure if they need to add more patient beds.The health region hopes the extra demand subsides.Share ToolsReport TypoSend FeedbackStay Connected with CBC NewsMobileFacebookPodcastsTwitterAlertsNewsletterBig Box AdvertisementLatest Saskatchewan News Headlines10 flee from Saskatoon house fireTwo people were injured in a Saskatoon residential fire early Thursday morning.more »Hospitals crammed in SaskatoonOfficials in Saskatoon say they have brought in extra staff and are assigning overtime hours in an effort to cope with what they are calling an unprecedented surge in hospital patients. more »NDP calls for 2nd look at school closuresThe NDP wants the province to review the closures of two Regina schools, but the minister of education says it's not going to happen. more »Engine failure blamed in 2008 training jet crashA broken blade in a jet engine has been determined as the cause of a crash in 2008 at 15 Wing Moose Jaw, home to one of the air force's flight training schools. more »Traffic worries in Saskatoon's west endDozens of people who live in Saskatoon's west end showed up for a public meeting to hear how the city plans to manage traffic into a new neighborhood. more »Most RecentWatchListenShow previous slideShow next slideShow previous slideShow next slideTop News HeadlinesSyria protests continue against defiant AssadAnti-government protesters rallied for another night on the outskirts of Damascus, hours after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad made a surprise appearance at a pro-regime rally in the city centre, where he again vowed to end the months-long revolt against his rule.more »Afghan president condemns U.S. marines urination videoAfghan President Hamid Karzai condemns a video depicting what appears to be four U.S. marines urinating on the corpses of Taliban fighters, calling the apparent actions "completely inhumane" and demanding that the U.S. military punish the marines. more »RCMP spied on Bob Rae in 1960sNewly declassified documents reveal the RCMP spied on Bob Rae during his student activist days and likely amassed a personal file on the future interim Liberal leader. more »Haiti's struggle to build better homes after quakeInnovative building technology is one hope for the future in Haiti, where more than 500,000 people still live in temporary camps two years after a devastating earthquake. more »U.K. spies won't face charges for Guantanamo tortureAgents working for Britain's spy agencies won't face criminal charges over their alleged complicity in the mistreatment of former Guantanamo detainees, the country's top prosecutor says. more »More Headlines »Most ViewedMost CommentedPassport officials expect to reject many photosMan visited emergency 150 times, Wall saysTraffic worries in Saskatoon's west endHospitals crammed in SaskatoonIcy walks raise bylaw questionsEngine failure blamed in 2008 training jet crashFatherhood in aboriginal families examined in showParoled child killer back behind barsSex on duty costs Saskatoon police officerFeatures »Expanded local serviceCBC announces Saskatoon morning radio showNew show will launch in 15 monthsEvents »BLIND SPOT - What Happened to Canada's Aboriginal Fathers?
