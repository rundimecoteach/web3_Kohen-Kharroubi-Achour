(Sven Hoppe)DNA testing for the human papilloma virus in cervical cancer screening is the best option for detecting the cancer in women over 30, finds a new study.The report finds suggests that HPV detection through DNA screening is more sensitive than standard Pap tests in detecting precancerous high-grade lesions on the cervix. High-risk HPV was present in nearly all cervical cancers, the authors say. In the study, women were randomly assigned to receive either HPV DNA testing and cytology or cytology alone. A second screening was conducted five years later and HPV and cytology tests were conducted at that point.The first screen found significantly more precancerous lesions (dysplasia) of Grade 2 or worse than cytology screens alone. Five years later, the second screen found significantly fewer women had cervical cancer lesions of Grade 3 or worse. The most advanced form of dysplasia, CIN 3, is actually the very earliest form of cancer, according to the Canadian Cancer Society. The authors belive that because more lesions were found at earlier stages in the first round of screening, there were significantly fewer advanced cases of cervical cancer five years later.“Implementation of HPV DNA testing in cervical screening leads to earlier detection of clinically relevant CIN Grade 2 or worse, which when adequately treated, improves protection against CIN Grade 3 or worse and cervical cancer," reads the study.Whether HPV testing is a better diagnostic tool in a longer screening period has not been established, say the authors.The report, Human papilloma virus testing for the detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer, was conducted by researchers at the VU University Medical Centre in Amsterdam and involved 45,000 women aged 29 to 56 between January 1999 and September 2002.It is published in the Wednesday online edition of the Lancet.Share ToolsReport TypoSend FeedbackStay Connected with CBC NewsMobileFacebookPodcastsTwitterAlertsNewsletterBig Box AdvertisementTop News HeadlinesBaird tells Canadians in Syria to 'leave now'Canadians in Syria are being told to get out now by Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird, who announced a voluntary evacuation Thursday.more »Multiple suspicious deaths probed south of CalgaryRCMP are investigating at least two homicides south of Calgary, with two other people taken to hospital in life-threatening condition. more »Canada-U.S. deal could close small border crossingsCanada and the U.S. have been negotiating to do away with some small border crossings and merge others as part of the far-reaching perimeter security deal recently announced between the two countries. more »Canada's 10 fastest-rising queries on GoogleCanadians were pragmatic Googlers in 2011, making the census website and the Canada Post strike two of the three fastest-rising searches of the year, Google reports. more »NDP says it held Harper to account this fallThe NDP's interim leader Nycole Turmel said Thursday that her party was an effective Official Opposition party this fall, as she listed what she called the government's embarassments. more »More Headlines »Most RecentWatchListenShow previous slideShow next slideShow previous slideShow next slideLatest Health News HeadlinesMP to highlight youth tanning dangersA Manitoba MP and a director at the Canadian Cancer Society will be making an announcement about the dangers of artificial tanning equipment and the skin cancers they pose to youth under 18. more »HPV DNA test best at detecting cervical cancerDNA testing for the human papilloma virus in cervical cancer screening is the best option for detecting the cancer in women over 30, finds a new study. more »Top 6 holiday heart saversHeart problems tend to increase during the holidays, spiking at Christmas and New Year's, says a medical expert. more »Shift workers and seniors socially excludedPeople who do shift work and work outside standard hours as well as older people feel more excluded from society, according to a new U.K. study. more »Michalek joins NHL's growing concussion rollPhiladelphia Flyers star Claude Giroux is out indefinitely with a concussion. more »FEATURED HEALTHDR.
