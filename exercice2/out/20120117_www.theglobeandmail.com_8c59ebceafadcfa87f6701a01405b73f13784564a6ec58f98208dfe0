Coroners Service has asked for toxicology tests to be carried out as soon as possible to determine if ecstasy played a role in the death of a 16-year-old Langley boy.The tests, requested from the provincial toxicology lab, will determine whether the boy took the drug and, if he did, whether the doses he took contained PMMA (paramethoxy-methamphetamine), a drug recently linked to five deaths in the province.More related to this storyTainted ecstasy linked to five recent B.C. deathsCoroner probing 2011 ecstasy deaths for signs of deadly new chemical“Because of our concern around these [cases], we are trying to prioritize them and move them to the head of the queue,” Barb McClintock, a spokeswoman for the coroners office, said Monday, adding that it’s hoped results would be available within days.The Provincial Toxicology Centre will conduct the tests.The coroners service said Monday it was investigating the death of a boy who was with others when he reportedly took ecstasy along with other drugs on Jan. 15. When he collapsed, someone nearby called 911 and an ambulance arrived and rushed the boy to Langley Memorial Hospital, but he could not be revived.Last week, the Coroners Service announced that PMMA had been linked to five ecstasy-related deaths in the province in the past six months, with two of those deaths occurring in January. PMMA has also been linked to several recent deaths in Alberta.Police and the coroners office have emphasized the risks of taking ecstasy, saying there is no known safe dose.In an interview last week, chief coroner Lisa Lapointe said it isn’t clear whether the PMMA was in one batch or not.“It could be just the tip of the iceberg. There could be thousands and thousands of pills out there with PMMA,” Ms. Lapointe said Friday in an interview. “That’s the worry. We just don’t know. It’s an illicit substance.”It’s thought that PMMA is being introduced, perhaps accidentally, in the process of manufacturing ecstasy.The drug is not routinely tested for, but B.C. reviewed toxicology findings for 12 ecstasy-related deaths in 2011 and two deaths this year after PMMA was linked to ecstasy-related deaths in Alberta.Although PMMA was detected in five cases, the coroners service emphasized that 13 other ecstasy-related deaths in the same period did not involve PMMA.“The finding of PMMA in five recent cases confirms the danger that has always been associated with taking ecstasy: There is no guarantee of purity in a drug that is concocted for profit in a clandestine environment,” the office said.Police have said there are an average 20 deaths from ecstasy each year in British Columbia.27 commentsEmailTweetPrint/LicenseDecrease text sizeIncrease text sizeToday's Must ReadsGlobe DriveDeals of the week: Always read the fine printSportsPlushenko vs. Chan: Get ready for a skating showdownGlobe InvestorIs now the time to lock in my mortgage?LifeJay-Z vows to clean up his lyrics following daughter's birthLifeIs Rob Ford’s weight-loss goal realistic?More from The Globe and MailNewsCharged with espionage, naval officer seeks delay in bail hearingReport On BusinessCarney sees consumer debt burdens growing even fatterNutritionHealthy Eating Jump-Start Day 12: Eat one vegetarian mealTechnologyWikipedia, Reddit going dark to protest anti-piracy billMOST POPULAR STORIESCaptain of doomed cruise ship pleaded not to reboardNarrowly spurned by Liberals, Sheila Copps throws in the towelIranian regime ‘frightens me,’ Harper saysCharged with espionage, naval officer seeks delay in bail hearingGallery: Cruise ship disasterBack to topMORE TOP STORIESNewsCaptain of doomed cruise ship pleaded not to reboardOpinionsThis month's editorial cartoonsSportsThree Canadians storm into 2nd round at Australian OpenGlobe DriveAverage age of vehicles in U.S. hits record 10.8 yearsTechnologyGoogle spends big on online privacy charm offensiveTechnologyHeads up: Pedestrians injured or killed while wearing headphones triplesPhotosTV: Five shows worth watching tonightBest pictures from the past 24 hoursVideoNJ mom gives birth on PATH TrainCalgary couple describes cruise ship ordealStep inside the Arthur, a tiny shop of vintage wondersYou dirty rats!
