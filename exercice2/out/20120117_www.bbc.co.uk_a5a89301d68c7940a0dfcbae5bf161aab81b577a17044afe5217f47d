The number is printed on packaging and the base of the can.Experts insist there is no immediate health threat.The two bacteria identified - Pseudomonas stutzeri and Sphingomonas paucimobilis - are commonly found in soil, water and hospital environments and human infections are rare.The bacteria should not affect healthy people. However, those who suffer from existing sinus or nasal problems, have recently undergone surgery or have a weakened immune system may be at risk.The possible symptoms exhibited can be nasal or facial tenderness, discoloured mucus or a fever.Consumers are asked that if they have any of the affected batches, to stop using the product immediately and return it to the retailer. If they exhibit any of the symptoms listed above then they should consult a healthcare professional.More on This StoryRelated Internet linksMedicines and Healthcare products Regulatory AgencyThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sitesShare this pageDeliciousDiggFacebookredditStumbleUponTwitterEmailPrintMore Health storiesRSSIndian TB cases 'can't be cured'Tuberculosis which appears to be totally resistant to antibiotic treatment is reported for the first time by Indian doctors.Warning over fake malaria drugsLa Nina 'may abet' flu pandemicsTop StoriesFive bodies found in cruise wreckRadical cleric cannot be deportedWikipedia in anti-Sopa 'blackout'EU in legal move against HungaryIndian TB cases 'can't be cured'Features & AnalysisSounds of the seaWhy the US Navy doesn't want us listening to the ocean deepTeen fashion editor WatchWhat it takes to be a successful young bloggerDay in pictures24 hours of news photos from around the worldAchilles heel?London trying to avoid Olympic traffic meltdownMost PopularShared1: Wikipedia in anti-Sopa 'blackout'2: Radical cleric cannot be deported3: What is it like to be asexual?4: Listening to the sounds of the deep ocean5: Indian TB cases 'can't be cured'Read1: Five bodies found in cruise wreck2: What is it like to be asexual?3: Wikipedia in anti-Sopa 'blackout'4: Schoolgirl dies during PE lesson5: Profile: Capt Francesco Schettino6: How safe are modern cruise ships?7: EU prepares warning for Hungary8: Listening to the sounds of the deep ocean9: Radical cleric cannot be deported10: Indian TB cases 'can't be cured'Video/Audio1: Recording tells captain 'go on deck' Watch2: Women dice with death on M6 Watch3: Footage shows scene in stricken liner Watch4: Night vision film of ship rescue Watch5: Online teen-editor's secrets to success Watch6: 'Spider-goat' makes silk in milk Watch7: Rescue divers blast holes in ship Watch8: One-minute World News Watch9: Captain made 'reckless manoeuvre' Watch10: Have cruise ships become too big?
