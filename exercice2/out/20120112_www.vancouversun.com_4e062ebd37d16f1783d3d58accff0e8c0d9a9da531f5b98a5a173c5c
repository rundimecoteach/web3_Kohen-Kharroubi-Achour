RSSTreating depression can help economy: StudyÂÂBy Derek Abma, Postmedia NewsJanuary 11, 2012ÂTweetComment0ÂStoryPhotos ( 1 )ÂÂA new report from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says one in five workers is struggling to cope with some form of mental illness, such as depression or anxiety, which affects productivity and well-being in the workplace. Another report suggests the workplace would save money if it invested in treatment.Photograph by: Stock photo, ThinkstockOn top of the personal anguish suffered by someone afflicted with depression, a new study shows that, gone untreated, this form of mental illness also takes a toll on the economy.Research from the Toronto-based Centre for Addiction and Mental Health indicates treatment for depression can help people suffering from the condition stay productive on the job.The centre said mental illness, in general, costs the Canadian economy about $51 billion a year, with one-third of that due to lost productivity.Surveys of 3,000 Alberta workers in 2009 found that, among the 255 people indicating they suffered a depressive episode within a year of being interviewed, those who received treatment were more likely to report being able to function at a highly productive level at work.Carolyn Dewa, who heads the centre's research division for workplace health, said such finds make sense, given common symptoms of depression, such as concentration loss and insomnia."To get help with some of those symptoms would really help people to better function," she said.Those who reported experiencing a severe depressive episode were seven times more likely to report being able to perform at a highly productive rate if they had received treatment compared to those untreated.For those who went through a moderate episode, treatment made them 2.5 times more likely to reach this optimum level of productivity, the study found.The effect of treatment on those who had gone through a mildly depressive episode was not found to be significant.To be considered as having been depressed, a respondent had to point out at least a two-week period in the year previous to the interview when they felt depressed and had a lack of interest in regular activities. The degree of severity was determined by how many other symptoms they reported, such as a loss of appetite, low self-esteem and suicidal thoughts.In this study, it was found that 40 per cent of those who had experienced a severe depressive episode did not get treatment for it â which would include therapy, medication or both â 57 per cent reporting a moderate episode were untreated, and it was 82 per cent for those with mild symptoms.The centre called on employers to make treatment options for depression more accessible to their workers."It's not even just about out-of-pocket payments and things like that," Dewa said. "Can people get time off to go to the doctor or to get counselling? Because to get those kinds of treatment, often you have to go during working hours."She highlighted the value in employer-benefits plans that cover drugs and therapy for depression.Dewa said it typically costs an employer about $18,000 if a worker takes a leave of absence due to mental illness, due to the disruption in workflow. While it's unclear what it would cost organizations to improve the accessibility of treatment options â which also could include a communications policy to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness â she said it would be less expensive than having the employee take leave.She added that including mental-health drugs and therapy under the umbrella of universal, publicly funded health care is worth consideration.The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health's study follows a report from the Organization for Economic Development and Co-operation last month pointing out the drag mental illness has on worker productivity in industrialized countries all over the world, and how it hurts individuals' chances of employment.dabma@postmedia.comTwitter.com/derekabmaÂ© Copyright (c) Postmedia NewsÂÂÂE-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleShare this ArticleÂÂÂÂLocation refreshedMore on This StoryÂAntidepressant, talk therapy fail to beat placeboMental illness affecting productivityToo little exercise, too much TV tied to depressionLiving well with mental illnessÂStory ToolsÂE-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleÂFont:*****ÂImage:****ÂÂÂÂÂÂA new report from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says one in five workers is struggling to cope with some form of mental illness, such as depression or anxiety, which affects productivity and well-being in the workplace.
