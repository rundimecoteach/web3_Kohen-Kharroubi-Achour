By the time emergency crews arrived, Ammaria was in cardiac arrest. She died a short time later at a local hospital.Her mother, Laura Pendleton, told WTVR-TV that she couldn't understand what had gone so wrong."She has an allergy action plan at the school," said Pendleton, who told the TV station she authorized the school to give her child Benadryl during an allergic reaction. "They didn't do that."FOOD ALLERGY SYMPTOMSShe added that she had tried to provide the school with an EpiPen, a single-dose emergency injection tool, but had been told to keep it at home.Police told ABC News the investigation found no criminal wrongdoing."Although not a crime, Ammaria's death is a tragedy and the Chesterfield County Police Department expresses its deepest sympathies to her family, classmates and school personnel as they deal with this difficult and painful event," police chief Col. Thierry Dupuis told ABC in a statement.The case has been especially alarming to parents and doctors who have seen peanut allergies in children triple over the past 10 years with two in every 100 children reportedly affected.One doctor told ABC News that he believed stocking EpiPens in schools may be a good idea to prevent future tragedies."There are kids who don't know they're food allergic until they get into the food," Dr. Dan Atkins told ABC. "In that situation, it would be good to have an EpiPen available."Post a Comment »Ads by Yahoo!Most PopularMost ReadMost Shared1
