The scans were compared with that of 16 individuals who were not addicted.The findings, published in the online journal Public Library of Science One, revealed that the changes were similar to brain alterations observed in people addicted to alcohol and cocaine."Overall, our findings indicate that IAD [internet addiction disorder] has abnormal white matter integrity in brain regions involving emotional generation and processing, executive attention, decision-making and cognitive control," head researcher Dr. Hao Lei and colleagues wrote, according to the BBC.About five to 10 percent of people who use the internet are believed to be addicted, with most of them being gamers who play for hours without food and drink and neglect other aspects of their lives, The Independent reported."The majority of people we see with serious internet addiction are gamers -- people who spend long hours in roles in various games that cause them to disregard their obligations," said Henrietta Bowden Jones, a psychiatrist who runs the UK's only taxpayer-funded clinic for both gambling and internet addicts."I have seen people who stopped attending university lectures, failed their degrees or their marriages broke down because they were unable to emotionally connect with anything outside the game," she said."When someone comes to you and says they did not sleep last night because they spent 14 hours playing games, and it was the same the previous night, and they tried to stop but they couldn't -- you know they have a problem," Bowden Jones added.However, a drugs expert has questioned the study, saying that other stimulants might have contributed to the brain changes."The limitations [of this study] are that it is not controlled, and it's possible that illicit drugs, alcohol or other caffeine-based stimulants might account for the changes. The specificity of 'internet addiction disorder' is also questionable," said Professor Michael Farrell, director of the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Australia.Cases of web addiction turned deadly have increasingly come to light in recent years -- with a British student dying after developing deep vein thrombosis while playing games on his Xbox for 12 hours straight.In the US, a mother from New Mexico was sentenced to 25 years in jail after her neglected three-year-old daughter starved to death while she was engrossed with fantasy role-playing game "World of Warcraft."Click here to read more.Share This ArticleNewsletter SignupSign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com.Newsletter SignupView ArticlePlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.You must login to comment.View ArticleAdvertisementTop Health CentersBack PainBeauty & SkinCancerCholesterolCold and FluDepressionDigestive HealthHeart DiseaseNutritionPain ManagementPregnancySexual HealthView All Health Centers »FOLLOW FOX NEWS HEALTHYoung GunsMarketing Startup That Doesn't Feel ManufacturedYoung Guns Reloaded: Wedding Bells, Babies and BusinessYoung Guns: Organic Baby Food SoarsWine Startup--for Oenophiles and Average Joes AlikeMore ›Latest Health VideosTrending In Health1When to take a mental health day from work2Coke says it found fungicide in orange juice37 Foods You Should Never Eat4Woman, 25, Suffers Rare Condition Preventing Puberty5Internet addiction causes brain changes similar to alcohol and drugs, study findsSee all trendsAdvertisementDon't Bring Her To The GymCollege Football ProgramsTebow TimeGoals For FitnessNFL PlayoffsClassic snacks under 80 caloriesWays to get your daily vitamin DDiet tips for Crohn's disease11 foods for healthy bonesCould you have type 2 diabetes?Labor Pains: Weekly Jobless Claims Rise to 6-Week HighRetail Sales Up Slim 0.1% In Dec.Bank of England Leaves Rates UnchangedComing Up: Jobless Claims, December Retail SalesBank Of England Leaves Monetary Policy UnchangedHow to Worry Less6 Easy Exercises to Strengthen Your CoreToo Much Fun in the Sun?Weird Symptoms, ExplainedVegetable Recipes for KidsCooking Light's 12 Healthy HabitsRecipes for Winter ProduceBest Fitness Gear and Gadgets10-Minute Ab WorkoutHoliday Recipes From Charleston ReceiptsGood Eats With Charleston ReceiptsPropelling Ground Meat to Presidental StatusOink, Oink, Happy ThanksgivingA Grown-Up Easy-Bake OvenIs It a Cold or the Flu?
