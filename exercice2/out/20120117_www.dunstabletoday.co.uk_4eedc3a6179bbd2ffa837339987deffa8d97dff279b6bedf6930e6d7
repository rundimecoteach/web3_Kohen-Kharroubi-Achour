In order to protect our patients, and members of the public, we are closing hospital wards to all visitors (with some exceptions).“Additionally we are asking the public only to come to A&E if it is a real emergency, and if people do need to come to A&E please don’t bring the whole family - just one person to accompany the patient.“These measures are necessary to protect our patients and public from the highly contagious norovirus which causes projectile vomiting and uncontrollable diarrhoea.”The ban on visitors is expected to last for 24-48 hours.The spokesperson said if members of the public think they may have winter vomiting disease, they should not go to A&E as there is no treatment for this virus, it needs to run its course over two or three days.The best advice is stay indoors, isolate yourself from other people and drink lots of water to keep rehydrated.For further advice call NHS Direct 0845 4647.Email to a friendPrint this pageLogged in as:Comment here.Please adhere to our Community guidelinesYour viewPlease sign in to be able to comment on this story.Top storiesDog barks up the wrong logUniversity RaG week kicks offPlans to double Luton Airport passengers to 18 million a yearWat-er great swim award!Police to star in TV documentaryNewsLocalRegionalReader PanelCampaigns & AppealsPhotos TodayVideosBlogsFacebookTwitterDigital EditionsBusinessHealthNationalPopularMost commentsMost sharedPlans to double Luton Airport passengers to 18 million a yearTown fall further behind leaders WrexhamDog barks up the wrong logFootballers open new estate agent officesHatters draw Kidderminster away in FA TrophyPREVIEW: Hatters need to proceed with caution after Cheltenham’s stunning away runStrike hits schools – but pub’s happy to help!Alan Dee’s pick of the week’s TV coming upElectric vehicle charging point in LeightonBrave Maggie has more surgerySearch for:
