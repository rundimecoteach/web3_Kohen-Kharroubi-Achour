asphyxiated in sleep and two others were taken seriously ill
after inhaling smoke from burning charcoal kept in an earthen
pot to get respite from the biting cold in Odisha's Kandhamal
district, police said today.
The incident occurred last night at Baliguda when the
deceased Arakhita Patra (60), his wife Prafulla Patra and son
Nilachal were sleeping in the room.
Other members of the family who were sleeping in an
adjacent room found the trio in an unconscious state in the
morning and immediately them to the local government hospital.
Arakhita was declared brought dead in the hospital.
As severe cold wave is sweeping the district for the
last few days, charcoal fire is a common way to keep the rooms
warm at night.
The fall in mercury level in almost every place to
below four degree celsius with layers of ice seen at
Daringbadi where the temperature had gone to minus two
degree celsius last week had affected normal life causing a
lot of inconvenience to the people.« PreviousNext »This is an automated news feed.
