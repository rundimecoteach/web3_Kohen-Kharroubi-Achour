The freezing weather caused the crane hydraulics to act up, seizing the equipment. Workers had to use a torch to heat it up to get it moving again.Then the wrecking ball fell off inside the building. No one was hurt and it was finally reattached but the work was significantly delayed through the morning.The century-old Maryland South building is being demolished as part of the $43-million redevelopment project.A new two-storey health complex will be constructed in its place.When the work is complete, Misericordia will be home to the province's eye care "centre of excellence" and will also house a new diagnostic imaging centre, a chronic care unit, a sleep lab clinic and renal dialysis centreThe centre will also introduce a "program of integrated managed-care for the elderly," or PRIME, that will combine medical and nursing care with leisure activities and family respite.Share ToolsReport TypoSend FeedbackStay Connected with CBC
