It was frightening,’ said 37-year-old Mrs Miller, from Aspatria, Cumbria. ‘He went for an operation that day and had to have dialysis.‘He was holding his head and screaming, he couldn’t move and was as stiff as a board.’The E.coli had entered Thomas’ bloodstream but further scans revealed it was also attacking his brain.Two golf ball-sized abscesses on his brain, which had caused him to go blind, were drained in August 2009 – allowing him to see again.But his ordeal wasn’t over as he developed more abscesses on the brain and even suffered an allergic reaction to the medication, which ‘burned’ his skin.Finally last year, after having all the abscesses removed, he was given the all clear. ‘I’ll never forget the day he came out of intensive care,’ said Mrs Miller. ‘It’s only really this year that I’ve been able to relax.’More like thisTop 10 Margaret Thatcher moments on the small (and big) screen22 hours agoTop 10 REAL April Fools' Day jokes8 days agoGalleryDiamond Jubilee barged sold to Portugal15 days agoTwo babies die after E.coli infectionDeadly E.coli outbreak sees Brits stop eating vegetablesBean sprouts to blame for E.coli outbreak, says GermanyCucumbers back under suspicion in E.coli huntEU criticised over E.coli aid packageAstronaut plans to grown cucumbers in space despite E.coli linkBy
