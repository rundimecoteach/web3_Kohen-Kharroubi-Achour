Surely that statistic is alarming enough to warrant an investigation?“If the health boards can learn from their mistakes, they can reduce the number of people who die needlessly in our NHS.“Patient safety and welfare is paramount, which is why I have written to the Health Minister demanding that she looks into this issue with a matter of urgency. This is clearly a systematic problem that the Labour Government needs to address.”The figures also raise concerns about whether health boards are reporting all incidents as Powys Local Health Board said there had been just one between April and September last year.But in the previous six months, the health board had reported 264 incidents, including one which resulted in the death of a patient.A spokesman for Powys Local Health Board said: “There has clearly been an error in the data published. We are looking into the process of preparing and uploading this data to identify the error. Once this is complete we will ensure that the report is corrected as soon as possible.”Overall, the April to September 2011 figures show there were 26,749 reported incidents, a 9% drop on the previous six-month period. The vast majority of these incidents – 91% – resulted in no or “low” harm to a patient.A Welsh Government spokesman said: “Every year, thousands of patients receive high quality, safe and effective treatment, but in a modern health system – where increasingly complicated procedures are being undertaken – sadly, mistakes can, and will, still happen.“When this happens, the NHS must investigate and take action, where appropriate, and provide assurances and feedback to patients.“As the figures show, the overwhelming majority of incidents result in no harm to patients. It is important every incident, no matter how small or serious, is reported to ensure they can be investigated and measures put in place to reduce the risk of them happening again.“We encourage high reporting as this provides organisations with more opportunities to learn from incidents and improve safety.“We know from research that high reporting is a positive indicator of an open and supportive safety culture.“The 1,000 Lives campaign saved an additional 1,199 lives in Welsh healthcare and staff continue to deliver major improvements on critical care wards, in operating theatres and in the community, including the reduction of pressure ulcers and healthcare associated infections.”Related Tags1000 lives plus,deaths,nhs,patient safety(What's this)Related StoriesNHS Wales chief executive David Sissling sets out five challenges facing the service in 2012Jan 9 2012Blind and deaf are ‘forgotten’ by NHS, report revealsJan 9 2012Blind patient discusses difficulties of accessing NHS servicesJan 9 2012Seventy-two million and rising - what happens to your prescription?Jan 9 2012NHS in Wales will pay to remove banned breast implantsJan 6 2012Head of NHS in Wales calls for reduction on spending on agency and locum staffJan 6 2012Data: NHS Agency Staff SpendJan 4 2012Should Chris Coleman be the next Wales football manager?ShareRelated StoriesNHS Wales chief executive David Sissling sets out five challenges facing the service in 2012Jan 9 2012Blind and deaf are ‘forgotten’ by NHS, report revealsJan 9 2012Blind patient discusses difficulties of accessing NHS servicesJan 9 2012Seventy-two million and rising - what happens to your prescription?Jan 9 2012NHS in Wales will pay to remove banned breast implantsJan 6 2012Site WebWalesonline Classifiedsbookanad.comJobs in WalesCars in WalesFind a dream datePhotosalesWales VouchersFind local businessHomes in WalesBuySellCashbackAdvertiseVideo ProductionLocalMole.co.uk Business FinderPlease enter a Business and Location.Pubs in CardiffPlumbers in CardiffRestaurants in CardiffBuilders in CardiffHotels in CardiffSchools in CardiffMore Cardiff Businesses »Accountants in CardiffArchitects in CardiffBeauty Salons in CardiffBusiness Centres in CardiffBusiness Services in CardiffCafes in CardiffCaravan Dealers in CardiffCar Dealers in CardiffCar Hire in CardiffCare Homes in CardiffCleaners in CardiffComputer Repair in CardiffDebt Advice in CardiffDentists in CardiffDoctors in CardiffDriving Schools in CardiffElectricians in CardiffEstate Agents in CardiffFlorists in CardiffFuneral Directors in CardiffGarden Centres in CardiffHairdressers in CardiffInsurance Services in CardiffLawyers in CardiffLocksmiths in CardiffMarketing Companies in CardiffMobile Phones in CardiffMuseums in CardiffNursery Schools in CardiffOffice Rental in CardiffPet Services in CardiffPlasterers in CardiffSolicitors in CardiffTakeaways in CardiffTaxis in CardiffWedding Services in CardiffList your business for free »Hot Topics »Boundary changesCelebrity Big BrotherKatherine JenkinsJoin our Flickr GroupJacks BanterBluebirds BanterPopular articlesWalesOnline, the best source for Welsh news, sport, business and entertainment.
