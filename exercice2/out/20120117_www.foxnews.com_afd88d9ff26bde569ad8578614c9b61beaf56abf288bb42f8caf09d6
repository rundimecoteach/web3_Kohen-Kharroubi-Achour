The number of incidents rose from 16 in 2004 to 47 in 2011."Everybody is aware of the risk of cell phones and texting in automobiles, but I see more and more teens distracted with the latest devices and headphones in their ears," lead author Dr. Richard Lichenstein said. "Unfortunately, as we make more and more enticing devices, the risk of injury from distraction and blocking out other sounds increases."The study, published in the journal Injury Prevention, found that young men were most at risk, with 68 percent of the 116 victims being male and 67 percent under the age of 30.Lichenstein and his team said that the distraction of the music causes "inattentional blindness," when multiple stimuli fed to the brain divide its mental resource allocation.Share This ArticleNewsletter SignupSign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com.Newsletter SignupView ArticlePlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.You must login to comment.View ArticleAdvertisementTop Health CentersBack PainBeauty & SkinCancerCholesterolCold and FluDepressionDigestive HealthHeart DiseaseNutritionPain ManagementPregnancySexual HealthView All Health Centers »FOLLOW FOX NEWS HEALTHYoung GunsBetting on Financial News Startup BenzingaMarketing Startup That Doesn't Feel ManufacturedYoung Guns Reloaded: Wedding Bells, Babies and BusinessYoung Guns: Organic Baby Food SoarsMore ›Latest Health VideosTrending In Health1Serious injuries triple for headphone-wearing pedestrians2Prevent cancer with ‘poor man’s pepper’3Louisiana toddler dies after 2-year battle with rare skin disease4Copper socks may have helped treat Chilean miners' foot infections5Woman loses arm, shoulder after injecting bath saltsSee all trendsAdvertisementMeaning Of FingersHealthy Eating And EducationRunning PlaylistDon't Bring Her To The GymCollege Football Programs7 steps to instant calmHow to fight stubborn heartburnFibromyalgia: a tricky diagnosis12 secrets for better orgasmsDiet tips for Crohn's diseaseComing Up: January Empire State IndexGerman ZEW Econ.
