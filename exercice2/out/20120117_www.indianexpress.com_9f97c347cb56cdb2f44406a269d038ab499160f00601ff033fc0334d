They drank 44 per cent less from cups with red labels.In the second part of the study, 109 people were given ten pretzels each on either a red, blue or white plate. Those with a red plate ate fewer pretzels.Red may be associated with alarm or something primeval, said Ursula Arens, from the British Dietetic Association.The results were published in the journal Appetite.Tags: red plate, lose weight, avoid snacking, food newsShare|Ads by GooglePrevious StoryUP polls: Maya drops 100 sitting MLAs from candidate listNext StoryIndia all set to lose No 2 spot in Test rankingReader's Comments(1) | Post a commentHow much more stupid can we getReply | Forwardconscience | 16-Jan-2012This is the height of the ridiculous please......Post your CommentName:Email:Title:Maximum characters allowedComment:Enter image textI agree to the terms of use.Group Sites :Express India |Financial Express |Screen India |Loksatta |Kashmir Live |Exims |Express TowersPrivacy Policy | Feedback | Site Map | Advertise With Us | Express Group | Contact Us | Subscribe© 2012 The Indian Express Limited.
