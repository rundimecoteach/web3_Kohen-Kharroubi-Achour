He wasn't moving. He was getting cold."Ms Wheaton told the inquest that she had not been told of the risks of the treatment used on Tama, who was given a Maori name meaning boy.Tama's father and Ms Wheaton held hands during the inquest, which continues before deputy state coroner Scott Mitchell.Increase Text SizeDecrease Text SizePrintEmailShareAdd to DiggAdd to del.icio.usAdd to FacebookAdd to KwoffAdd to MyspaceAdd to NewsvineWhat are these?Back to top of pageMore NewsGive trees the chop to save homesStephen Drill
