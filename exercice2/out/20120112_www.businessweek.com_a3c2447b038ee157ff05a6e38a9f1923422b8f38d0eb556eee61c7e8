The company previously closed the Lincoln, Neb., facility where the products were manufactured and says it does not know when operations will resume. Novartis expects to take a $120 million charge for the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the recalls.Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez cut his 2012 sales forecast and full-year earnings estimate for the company by $560 million and 20 cents per share, respectively. According to an investment note from Fernandez, the figure reflects the loss of a year's worth of sales of the recalled products, roughly $390 million, plus $170 million in lost production from an expected three-month shutdown of the facility.The Food and Drug Administration is currently investigating manufacturing and quality-control problems at the plant and is expected to be involved in approving the restart of operations."History suggests that few manufacturing challenges resolve quickly, but a partial resumption of manufacturing is certainly possible, although a resumption of manufacturing and a full recovery in the recalled brands are likely to take considerably longer to resolve, particularly given the FDA's involvement," Fernandez states.In a worst-case scenario, Fernandez expects Novartis would lose $750 million in income if all products manufactured at the Lincoln plant are suspended for one year. That would be a 30 to 35 cent cut in earnings per share.Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Novartis to earn $5.55 per share this year.In afternoon trading, U.S.-listed shares of Novartis fell 5 cents to $56.95.BW ExtrasPodcastsMandel on EconomicsBehind the CoverCEO Guide to Techmore…RSS FeedsMost PopularTop NewsInnovation Trendsmore…E-mailsAsia InsiderMBA ExpressBW.com Insidermore…BlogsBlogspottingHot PropertyTech Beatmore…Most Popular StoriesReadE-mailedDiscussedThree Types of People to Fire ImmediatelyTop B-School Stories of 2011Lego Is for GirlsTransocean: No Apologies Over Gulf Oil SpillIt's Always Sunny in Silicon ValleyRSS Feed: Most Read StoriesThree Types of People to Fire ImmediatelyWhich Is America's Best City?Lego Is for GirlsTop B-School Stories of 2011Professional Women and a Secure RetirementRSS Feed: Most E-mailed StoriesKorea's Next Challenge: Global CompetitivenessRSS Feed: Most Discussed StoriesMost Popular MultimediaSlide ShowsThe 20 Biggest Casinos2006 Best Global BrandsOlympic ArchitectureBest Young Tech Entrepreneurs 2009Fuqua Virtual TourRSS Feed: Most Popular Slide ShowsBW Mall - Sponsored LinksBuy a link now!Special ReportsFix This/TransportationCrisis in JapanHealth CareSentiment AnalysisMore Special ReportsBusiness ToolsB-School ComparisonB-School CalendarBW for MobileE-mail NewslettersRSSWhite PapersA-Z IndexBW AuthorsBX TopicsPrivate CompaniesPublic CompaniesLists & RankingsBest Global BrandsBest Places to Launch a CareerBest Providers of Customer ServiceBest Undergraduate Business SchoolsBusiness School Rankings & ProfilesBW 50: Best Performing CompaniesTop 100 IT CompaniesMost Innovative CompaniesFollow Us@BW on TwitterBW on FacebookBlogsEconoChatEuroCrisisJoshua Green on PoliticsOccupy Wall StreetSmall BusinessTechnology[+] Rate this pageSlideshow GalleryAutosBusiness SchoolsDesignInternationalInnovationInvestingManagingPolicyReal EstateSmall BusinessTechnologyMagazineCurrent IssueSubscribe NowBloombergAboutAdvertisingCustom PublishingEDGE ProgramsReprintsTerms of UseDisclaimerPrivacy NoticeEthics CodeContact UsSite Map©2012 Bloomberg L.P.
