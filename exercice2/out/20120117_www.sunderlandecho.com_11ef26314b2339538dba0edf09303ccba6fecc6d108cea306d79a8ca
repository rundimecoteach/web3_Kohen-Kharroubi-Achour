I don’t work in care any more, so I’ve got no grudges.”But an unannounced follow-up visit in December revealed major improvements at the home.The former worker said: “The outcome of the new report is great. I’m pleased that something has come out about it.“For me the residents always came first. I was getting them up at 3.30am. It was ridiculous.”The second report saw the home pass all five Government markers.It said: “The atmosphere was relaxed, peaceful and seasonal throughout the home. Staff were relaxed and told us how they were able to attend to individual needs and requests without feeling under pressure.“They knew about people’s individual preferences and normal routines and described how these were adhered to.”However, the report writer did recommend that staffing levels be monitored and ask the owners to report back to the CQC within 14 days.The home is owned by Barchester Healthcare, which cares for more than 10,000 people at more than 200 different locations.A spokeswoman for the company said: “At Washington Grange care home the well-being of our residents is of the utmost importance.“We’re very pleased to have received this well-balanced report from the Care Quality Commission which highlights the high standards of the care provided to the residents of Washington Grange.“It also reflects the commitment and great work of the team at Washington Grange care home.”Twitter: @janethejournoEmail to a friendPrint this pageTop storiesJobs boost as yet another new supermarket is coming to WearsidePervert fondled teens at Sunderland bowling alleyPolice hunt Sunderland robber who left 84-year-old woman injuredMiddlesbrough fans furious as Sunderland give them only 3,000 seats for FA Cup derby clashHorden gunman had threatened to kill beforeNewsLocalNorth EastNationalBusinessEducationPoliticsCrimeHealthEnvironmentTraffic and TravelTalking Pagesloading...PopularMost commentsMost sharedSunderland boss O’Neill eyes recruits after Kilgallon’s Chelsea woeTRANSFER WINDOW: Algerian wonderkid offered Newcastle trialSunderland community’s shock as robbers attack elderly couple in their own homeJobs boost as yet another new supermarket is coming to WearsideBendtner has attacking faith despite Sunderland’s Chelsea blankSunderland boss O’Neill eyes recruits after Kilgallon’s Chelsea woeMichael Turner eager to keep his Sunderland place under Martin O’NeillBendtner has attacking faith despite Sunderland’s Chelsea blankJobs boost as yet another new supermarket is coming to WearsideMiddlesbrough fans furious as Sunderland give them only 3,000 seats for FA Cup derby clashJobs boost as yet another new supermarket is coming to WearsideGrand total for a worthy causeCouple’s dream comes true as Sunderland church hosts gay wedding blessingHospital parking nightmare for blue badge holdersA rise in help for
