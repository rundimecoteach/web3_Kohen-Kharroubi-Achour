Also included in the warning are Matakana and Motiti islands, and all other inshore islands along this coastline.The health warning applies to all bi-valve shellfish including mussels, pipi, tuatua, cockles, oysters, scallops as well as catseyes and kina (sea urchin). Shellfish in the affected area should not be taken or consumed. Paua, crayfish and crabs can still be taken but as always, the gut should be removed before cooking.Consumption of shellfish affected by the paralytic shellfish toxin can cause numbness and tingling around the mouth, face or extremities; difficulty swallowing or breathing; dizziness; double vision; and in severe cases, paralysis and respiratory failure. These symptoms usually occur within 12 hours of a person consuming affected shellfish. Anyone suffering illness after eating shellfish should seek medical attention.Monitoring of toxin levels will continue along the coast and any changes will be communicated accordingly.For all health warning updates across the Bay of Plenty and Lakes districts call 0800 221 555.TweetPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.Competitions and Giveaways from Gimme.co.nzPopular competitions and giveaways from Gimme.co.nz: NZ's People Powered Guide to Free Stuff.
