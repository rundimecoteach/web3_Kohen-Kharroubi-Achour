It was just not right. He was healthy except for an eye infection. He was a happy, happy boy. We just felt robbed."Sergeant Sheldon Korneluk, assisting the inquest, said today that Tama Galiere, born on August 22, 2007, had suffered an eye infection in February 2008 and had been treated successfully with antibiotics.He suffered the infection of the left eye again and was admitted to the children's hospital on June 10, 2008.A catheter was inserted through the groin into his heart for more treatment with antibiotics and he responded so well he was sent home on June 20.But the next day his mother noticed swelling again and he was readmitted on June 23. He then had a different catheter (a percutaneous intravenous central catheter, or PICC) inserted into his heart through an arm.Two days later, the child's condition deteriorated suddenly and, despite effects to resuscitate him, he died."The issue for the inquest is why a a 10-month-old otherwise healthy child could go into hospital and not survive," Sergeant Korneluk said."How does someone who goes into hospital for treatment for an eye infection die?"Ms Wheaton, who met her husband Pierra Galiere, a chef, in London, said in evidence that the child had had no ill-health before he was admitted to hospital apart from a cold.However, in the third hospitalisation from June 22, 2008, when the catheter was inserted through the arm, he had suffered gastric upset.When she saw him on June 25, she knew immediately that there was something seriously wrong. The baby was "as white as a ghost", she said. She had asked a nurse for some Panadol and the nurse went to get it but was in a hurry.The baby was injected with the Panadol but vomited it up again.Ms Wheaton had asked a nurse to get a doctor but the nurse said a doctor had just seen the child. But 15 minutes after the doctor saw the child, his lips had started to turn blue.Ms Wheaton said she had signed agreements to have both catheters inserted. But she did not recall discussions about the exact placement of the tip of the catheter at the top of the right atrium.Ad FeedbackNor had she been told about the possible adverse reactions and side-effects. She had not been told that it could result in the patient dying.In answer to Michael Williams, SC, for the family, Ms Wheaton said the nurse she had asked for help did not really seem to be listening to her and when the baby had vomited up the Panadol the nurse had said it was "common enough" in cases of gastric upset.When she insisted on getting a doctor, the nurse had "stormed off" and come back with a senior nurse.After the baby died, there had been a meeting with the hospital staff, she had been told that death could have come from the catheter, or from the gastric condition, or possibly a weak heart, or something wrong with the immune system. She had left confused and her husband angry.She had been told that, after it was inserted, the catheter might have "migrated" in the body, but they did not know why. It was also possible that, during efforts to resuscitate the baby, the catheter might have been pushed further into his heart.Outside court, Anna Walsh, of the legal firm Maurice Blackburn, representing Tama's parents, said: "The port-mortem report for Tama revealed myocarditis [inflammation of the heart] with a distinct possibility of physical trauma due to placement of the PICC line."Tama's death raises issues about the insertion and management of PICC lines in babies and whether the hospital had appropriate clinical guidelines in place to guide good practice."-Sydney Morning HeraldNext Australia story:Young Australian lovers die tragicallyWorld HomepageSponsored linksShare this pageEmailFacebookMySpaceDiggStumbleUponDeliciousRedditLinkedinTwitterWorld HeadlinesRSSExplosions used in cruise ship searchRomney unscathed from debateNZ fur seal deaths in Australia still unexplainedMystery of woman's body in the treeCharge dropped for man who 'mooned' the QueenHospital patients mistakenly billed for millionsBA's emergency landing blunderCave divers race against time to find survivors on shipCruise stunt flagged on FacebookThirteen killed in Beirut building collapseHuntsman drops out of Republican raceNo public funding in UK for new royal yachtGreece default fears grow'Healthy' baby dies after hospital visitAd FeedbackStuff HeadlinesRSSFirefighters battle blaze in HastingsWoman attacked at Auckland schoolOutrage at Wainui brothel commentBig Day Out 2012 to be last in New ZealandCar keys led to drain death: policeRobson creates gay rights stir at Australian OpenNZ fur seal deaths in Australia still unexplainedWainuiomata outraged over brothel commentsZion buyer lined up: receiversDriver's 170kmh Hilux trip on iPod: courtLocal Maori to bury jawbone found on beachAuckland board members weigh in on port disputeCar maker builds a better iPhone caseTrans-Tasman cable agreement madeWikipedia to shut for 24 hours in protestSpecial offersMost popularViewedSharedCommentedFirefighters battle blaze in HastingsWoman left naked in street after attackBig Day Out 2012 to be last in New ZealandWoman attacked at Auckland schoolCar keys led to drain death: policeChristchurch shaken by 4.1 earthquake aftershockOutrage at Wainui brothel commentRobson creates gay rights stir at Australian OpenShane Warne in road rage incident with cyclistCruise stunt flagged on FacebookAuckland board members weigh in on port disputeAuckland board members weigh in on port disputeFirefighters battle blaze in HastingsAuckland local boards weigh in on port disputeBig Day Out 2012 to be last in New ZealandLife on the edge of a raw nerveChristchurch shaken by 4.1 earthquake aftershockWoman attacked at Auckland schoolWoman left naked in street after attackGreipel wins opening Tour Down Under stageFeatured PromotionsSponsored ContentNationalWorldBusinessTechnologySportEntertainmentLife & StyleTravelBlogsCompetitionsStuff.co.nzAbout Us|Contact Us|Mobile|View Smartphone Site|View Mobile Light SiteSubscribeText|Follow us on Facebook and Twitter|Newspapers|Magazine subscriptionsServicesNewspapers in Education|A-Z Directories|Online Advertising|Print Advertising|CareersClassifiedsTrade Me|Jobs|Property|Motors|Accommodation|Personals|Newspaper ClassifiedsNewspapersDominion Post|The Press|Waikato Times|Auckland Now|Sunday News|Sunday Star-TimesMarlborough Express|Manawatu Standard|Nelson Mail|Southland Times|Taranaki Daily News|Timaru HeraldOther SitesCuisine|NZ House & Garden|NZ Fishing News|NZ Life & Leisure|NZ Gardener|Fairfax
