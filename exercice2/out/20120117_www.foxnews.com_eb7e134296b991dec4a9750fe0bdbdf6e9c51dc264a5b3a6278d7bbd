"This supports the surgeon general's recommendation that drinking be avoided entirely."The new findings were published today (Jan. 16) in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research.Pregnancy and substancesChambers and her colleagues recruited the 992 participants for their study from pregnant women who called a California telephone help line that answers questions on substances that could be harmful during pregnancy — including not only alcohol and illegal drug intake, but also chemical exposures andprescription drug safety.Women who called the line between 1978 and 2005 were asked if they'd like to participate in a follow-up study. All were contacted by phone for follow-up on levels ofalcohol consumption throughout pregnancy, and their infants were screened after birth with a full physical exam."You're dealing with an issue here in which it's really hard to get good information on both exposure and outcomes," Chambers said. "Most kids don't get diagnosed until they're in school and having learning difficulties," Chambers said.In the study, the doctors who examined the infants did not know whether the child had been exposed to alcohol or some other substance in utero.Higher alcohol consumption of a mother during pregnancy, the researchers found, was linked with a higher chance of a baby having physical characteristics associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, including abnormal head size and altered shape of the eyes and lips. Such symptoms suggest the presence of related neurological problems.Binge drinking, which involves drinking more than four drinks on a single occasion, didn't affect the risk — the total number of drinks a woman had while pregnant was more predictive of a baby's risk of fetal alcohol syndrome, the researchers found.During the second half of the first trimester, every one drink per day increase in alcohol intake raised the odds of a certain physical abnormality — in the upper lip — by 25 percent. In contrast, the average number of drinks during the third trimester seemed to affect only the baby's length at birth.Different mothers, different riskThere are still questions about what factors may influence the risk of fetal alcohol syndrome, Chambers said. "Even if you find 10 women who drink a quart of vodka a day, maybe only five of those babies will have full-blown fetal alcohol syndrome, because there are other factors that influence the risk."Those factors could include diet, body fat levels, genetic differences, or other environmental exposures, said Ed Riley of San Diego State University, who also studies prenatal exposure to alcohol.Other studies have found little or no affect on babies born tomothers who drank only occasionally— having one or two drinks a week — throughout pregnancy. But most previous studies relied on mothers' recall of their drinking after birth, whereas in the new study, researchers interviewed women periodically throughout pregnancy.Riley said the new study adds weight to the argument against drinking any alcohol during pregnancy, and emphasized that the new study showed that any alcohol consumption led to an increased risk. "They showed no threshold effect," he said, "so the more you drank, the greater probability of having an adverse outcome."Future studies, he said, could follow the same method to look at not only physical abnormalities of the infants, but neurological problems as well. "We know that the brain is very sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure," he said.Pass it on: Any amount of alcohol consumption during pregnancy raises the chances that the fetus will develop birth defects, new research concludes. The risk is highest when pregnant women drink during the second half of the first trimester.11 Big Fat Pregnancy Myths11 Tips to Lower Stress11 Interesting Effects of OxytocinShare This ArticleNewsletter SignupSign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com.Newsletter SignupView ArticlePlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.You must login to comment.View ArticleAdvertisementTop Health CentersBack PainBeauty & SkinCancerCholesterolCold and FluDepressionDigestive HealthHeart DiseaseNutritionPain ManagementPregnancySexual HealthView All Health Centers »FOLLOW FOX NEWS HEALTHYoung GunsBetting on Financial News Startup BenzingaMarketing Startup That Doesn't Feel ManufacturedYoung Guns Reloaded: Wedding Bells, Babies and BusinessYoung Guns: Organic Baby Food SoarsMore ›Latest Health VideosTrending In Health1What your looks say about your health2Study: Babies try lip-reading in learning to talk3Cognitive behavioral therapy reduces pain4Woman loses arm, shoulder after injecting bath salts5Louisiana toddler dies after 2-year battle with rare skin diseaseSee all trendsAdvertisementMeaning Of FingersHealthy Eating And EducationRunning PlaylistDon't Bring Her To The GymCollege Football Programs7 steps to instant calmHow to fight stubborn heartburnFibromyalgia: a tricky diagnosis12 secrets for better orgasmsDiet tips for Crohn's diseaseFDIC Proposes Stress Tests For Large BanksNY Manufacturing Activity Ramps Up in JanuaryEU's Van Rompuy: Jobs Should Be Top ConcernJanuary Empire State Index Jumps To 13.5Coming Up: January Empire State Index6 Diet Trends to SkipWhat Do Common Symptoms Tell You?A Guide to Common Dental Problems6 Easy Resistance Band ExercisesVegetable Recipes for KidsCooking Light's 12 Healthy HabitsRecipes for Winter ProduceBest Fitness Gear and Gadgets10-Minute Ab WorkoutHoliday Recipes From Charleston ReceiptsGood Eats With Charleston ReceiptsPropelling Ground Meat to Presidental StatusOink, Oink, Happy ThanksgivingA Grown-Up Easy-Bake OvenIs It a Cold or the Flu?
