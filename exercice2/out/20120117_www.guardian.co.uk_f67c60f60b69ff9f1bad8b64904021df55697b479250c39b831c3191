at 11.32 GMT on Tuesday 17 January 2012.'We've had skin creams loaded with nano-capsules, vitamins A, C and E, antioxidants and things with even longer names.' Photograph: David Levene for the GuardianI don't suppose I'm in the target group for Yves Saint Laurent's new skin cream Forever Youth Liberator – but what if I did want to know whether it's worth shelling out 60 quid for a 50ml tub? I could be wowed by the (strangely similar) media reports. "It is likely to be one of the most sought after face creams ever," says the Telegraph. "5,000 women have already pre-ordered a face cream using ingredients which scientists claimed would change the world." Or as the Daily Mail puts it, the cream is "hailed as the 'holy grail' of anti-ageing". (You have to read on to discover that it's Amandine Ohayon, general manager of Yves Saint Laurent, who is doing the hailing here.)But I'm hard to please. I want to know about the science supporting these claims. After all, cosmetics companies have been trying to blind us with science for years – perhaps ever since the white coats began to appear in the DuPont chemical company's ads ("Better things for better living … through chemistry") in the 1930s. Recently we've had skin creams loaded with nano-capsules, vitamins A, C and E, antioxidants and things with even longer names."The science behind the brand lies in the groundbreaking technology of Glycobiology," one puff piece tells us. "It's been noted as the future in the medical field, the fruit of more than 100 years of research and recognized by seven Nobel Prizes." The Telegraph, meanwhile, parrots the PR that, "the cream has been 20 years in development, and has the backing of the Max Planck Institute in Germany".I rather wish that, as a chemist, I could say this is all tripe. But it's not as simple as, say, claims by bottled-water companies to have a secret process that alters the molecular structure of water to assist hydration. For example, it's true that glycobiology is a big deal. This field studies an undervalued and once unfashionable ingredient of living cells: sugars. Glycans are complicated sugar molecules that play many important biological roles. Attached to proteins at the surfaces of our cells, such sugars act as labels that distinguish different cell types – for example, they determine your blood group. Glycans and related biochemicals are an essential component of the way our cells recognise and communicate with one another.Skin cells – essentially, tissue-generating cells called fibroblasts – produce glycans and other substances that form a surrounding extracellular matrix, Some of these glycans attract water and keep the skin plump and soft. But their production declines as fibroblasts age, and so the skin becomes dry and wrinkled. Skin creams routinely contain glycoproteins and glycans to redress this deficit.Fine – but what's so different about the new cream? It's based on a combination of artificial glycans trademarked Glycanactif. Selfridges tells us that they "unlock the cells to reactivate their vital functions and liberate the youth potential at all levels of the skin". Well, it would be nice if cells really were little boxes brimming with "youth potential", just waiting to be "unlocked", but this statement is basically voodoo.So I contact YSL. And – what do you know? – they sent me some useful science. It's surrounded by gloss and nonsense ("Youth is a state of mind that cannot live without science"), and exposed as the source of that garbled soundbite from Selfridges. But it also shows that YSL has enlisted some serious scientists, most notably Peter Seeberger, a specialist in glycan chemistry at the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces in Berlin. And it explains that, instead of just supplying a source of glycans in the extracellular matrix to make up for their reduced production in ageing cells, Glycanactif apparently binds to glycan receptors on the cell surface and stimulates them to start making the molecules (including other glycans and related compounds) needed for healthy skin.Tough-skinned cynic that I am about the claims of cosmetics manufacturers, I am nonetheless emolliated – if not exactly rejuvenated. True, there's nothing in the leaflet to prove that FYL does a better job than other skin creams. And the science remains very sketchy in places so (this is true of any claims for cosmetics) we'd reserve judgment until the long-term clinical trials, if it were a drug. But I'm offered a troupe of serious scientists ready to talk about the work and I'm open to persuasion.Still, it puzzles me. How many of the thousands of advance orders, or no doubt the millions to come, will have been based on examination of the technical data? I know we lack the time, and usually the expertise, for such rigour. So what really informs our decision to shell out 60 quid on a tiny tub of youthfulness? And if the science was all nonsense, would it make a difference?Printable versionSend to a friendShareClipContact uslarger |

Linkmiladear17 January 2012 12:10PMThanks for the article. That's exactly the type of skincare product reviews that are so needed. It doesn't stop to astonish me how people (well, women mostly) blindly accept cosmetics companies' claims and part themselves with large amounts of cash in exchange for more often than not useless products. I don't understand how cosmetics companies are allowed to get away with selling total rip offs either. The only way to counteract this until the legislation catches up is, us as consumers to get a chance to read more reviews like this. Personally, I use Paula Begoun's www.beautypedia.com all the time and her unbiased scientific reviews of thousands of products have saved me loads of money. I hope The Guardian make this as a permament feature column in the future.Recommend?

Linkdorice17 January 2012 12:12PMSadly, it's all just and extension of the belief that homeopathy actually works.And it doesn't.I once overheard a family friend praising her new (and expensive) 'wonder lotion' to my ex.I couldn't resist it, and asked her to explain how the particular 'wonder ingredient' worked.Obviously, she had no idea, so I went upstairs and returned with a huge container of a general purpose cream I'd bought from the chemist. I used to climb. hill-walk, run, and cycle a lot, and it helped chapped and damaged areas.My ex also used it as a moisturiser (dry skin).I showed her the 'wonder' ingredient in my cream, and yes, it was the same as hers.Mine came in small bucket size.Hers a tiny tub.Both had the same ingredients (mine wasn't perfumed though).Mine cost £4.50Hers £33.99.Looks like nothing has changed - the gullible are still everywhere, and so are those who take advantage of them and their vanity.Recommend?

We know that creams are all pretty much the same, and the only things that stops your skin wrinkling are good health, good genes, and staying out of the sun. So there should be more articles like this, the press, on the whole, are far too uncritical and desperate for the advertising revenue to have a real go at this nonsensical pseudo-science.Recommend?

What 18 year old has wrinkles or other signs of ageing? I use a serum with hylarunic acid in it.. which just temporarily plumps up the skin a bit. As far as I'm aware that's about the most you can expect a product to do.. They don't rid you of wrinkles, they just (might) make them look a little less deep.. So where's the evidence for or the logic in slapping that stuff on at 18?I can see that keeping young skin simply moisturised would be a good idea to keep it supple... and telling young people to keep out of the sun and what not.. But anti-ageing creams? Surely not!Recommend?

LinkPinkpearl17 January 2012 12:58PMResponse to kizbot, 17 January 2012 12:47PMYou have answered your own question. It's virtually impossible to get rid if wrinkles with a cream. Like you say, the best you can hope for is to plump up your lines temporarily with a serum. However continued use of a good product can prevent wrinkles from forming. This is the point about starting young. Prevention is better than cure. You don't use anti wrinkle cream at 18 to treat wrinkles, of course that's pridicllus. You use it to prevent them developing (although I agree 18 is maybe a little early).Recommend?

Link234567817 January 2012 1:25PMThe main thing I would do is check the list of ingredients. Very few seem to be concerned about the complex mix of chemicals they are putting on their skins every day. Many of these chemicals are absorbed into the body, as well as the skin, few of them are properöly tested.In addition, none of them have been tested in mixtures together, so we have no idea what chemical A does wihen mixed with chemical B and absorbed.. and processed through the organs or chemical A, B and C all together.This product like most I guess will have at least 20 ingredients... add that to the 5-10 other products people rountinely use each day.. the mess is horrible.If you want to stay healthy, and therefore usually younger looking, cut back on the chemicals and forget all this hype.Recommend?
