It was last modified at 00.06 GMT on Wednesday 14 December 2011.I read your reports (NHS watchdog under fire for putting patient care at risk, 2 December; Neglect and indignity: Stafford hospital inquiry damns NHS failings, 2 December) about the Mid Staffs hospital public inquiry and the failings of the Care Quality Commission (CQC) with fear, anger and a little hope. They brought back the suffering my parents experienced where poor hospital and care-home practice went unchallenged.Too many hospital trusts and local authorities fail to learn lessons and acknowledge mistakes; so repetition is inevitable. In Mid Staffs, the "silence from doctors and nurses", with few honourable exceptions, ensured that the desperate attempts to cut costs to become a foundation trust had fatal consequences. The "shocking catalogue of appalling care" you report at Mid Staffs was a microcosm of what the NHS and social care could become.These are avoidable tragedies. Hospitals and social services inevitably make mistakes. Good organisations want to know about such mistakes and learn from them. But the CQC has utterly failed to challenge the widespread absence of a learning culture. Indeed, it failed to blow the whistle on its own underfunding, gagged its own whistleblowing inspectors, cut its inspections catastrophically by 70% between 2009 and 2011 and generally, as you state, had an "unhealthy organisational culture".Its astonishing litany of shortcomings is rooted in previous government funding cuts and the desire for more "light touch" regulation. Key NHS leaders remain in denial, despite the recent inquiries. Cynthia Bower of CQC claims "we have learned, reviewed what we do and made changes", while Sue Slipman of the Foundation Trust Network claims the CQC's judgments are "disproportionate". The CQC has indeed failed us all, but it is far from being the only culprit.Health secretary Andrew Lansley, who rightly established the Mid Staffs inquiry, now presides over changes that will make another scandal more likely. You report that he "has kept a close eye on proceedings", but the next such inquiry will undoubtedly conclude that his market-led NHS and huge cuts in health and social care budgets were the prime suspects, alongside the failure to protect whistleblowers. As someone who has represented victimised whistleblowers, I am not surprised the RCN reports that 84% of nurses worry that they'd be victimised if they reported concerns about patient safety, something the planned extension of the qualifying period for employment protection will make worse.Yet there is also hope. Despite the immense obstacles, brave souls do raise concerns, often risking their careers. There is a powerful case for the inquiry to recommend strengthened statutory protection for whistleblowers and serious penalties for those who victimise them. Will Andrew Lansley endorse such a recommendation?Health and social care organisations should be open learning organisations where those raising concerns are praised, not ignored or punished. All of us, individually and collectively, have a duty to ensure there are enough staff, treated fairly, and encouraged to raise concerns. Nothing less will do.Printable versionSend to a friendShareClipContact uslarger |

LinkXtofer13 December 2011 7:33PMI'm probably not going to put this very well, but here goes. If you want to have constructive whistle-blowing, near-miss reporting and learning from mistakes, then it needs to be enshrined in law and backed up with resources. Look at other industries and see how variable it is. Whistle-blowing and near-miss reporting is now kind of there in the rail industry. It's embedded in the aviation industry and completely absent in the finance and media industries. The route to this is likely through health and safety legislation (implementation and enforcement of which has been eviscerated over the last couple of decades) in order to maintain a protected route for anonymous reporting. There is no special case pleading for any of these industries.Recommend?

LinkFainche13 December 2011 7:33PMThe exposure by Panorama on Winterbourne Care Home being a case in point where Terry Bryan's complaints to the management were totally ignored.When 'profits before people' is the main driver for any organisation it's almost obligatory that consideration for the customer is sacrificed for financial gain. If the same principle is applied to the NHS then I'd expect their 'whistleblowing' hotline to go into meltdown.Recommend?

Linkdorice13 December 2011 7:38PMYes. More whistleblowers is a must , and not just within the NHS !Before, during, and after the London riots the Guardian published several articles related to deaths in police custody, although nothing was said about the FACT (they're sacred, remember ?) that all but 6 or 7 of those deaths were 'natural causes'.In several of my responses I drew attention to the BMA's own concern about 'avoidable deaths in English hospitals'.I was shocked when I saw the figures ! Remember, the Guardian had been pushing the IPCC's figure of 333 'Deaths in Police Custody' in 12 years as a national scandal...... but had said nothing about the 35 - 40,000 avoidable deaths recorded by the NHS (in England) over the same period.The causes are the same - neglect, bad practice, lack of supervision, medical mistakes, wrong diagnosis, and yes - criminal activity.When I read the BMA report, I felt guilty, because 20-odd years ago I remember a nurse, someone I knew very well, laughing at the 'fact' that the death rate in a geriatric ward had trebled since she started working there. At the time I wasn't sure if she was being serious, but in the last 10 years, cases where the elderly HAVE been 'dispatched' by those medics who are supposed to be caring for them in hospital have shocked us all.Has the same thing happened in care homes ?Has it happened to seriously disabled people ?If 'Yes', then someone must have their suspicions - yet they stay silent.I know that medics 'close ranks'. I've witnessed it. Records disappearing - statements being changed - sudden memory lapses in court - and so on.So until the NHS (England) has a equivalent of the IPCC, we need whistleblowers to force the Governments hand.Recommend?

Linkdrmavis13 December 2011 8:21PMAs an NHS employee I can tell you this will never happen. NHS Managers are not interested in following ANY policies or even laws. They produce policy documents etc to show that they 'take it seriously' and then completely ignore them. Any employee who speaks out against any manager/director for whatever reason, is NEVER listened to; and God help you if you point the finger at a Consultant Surgeon. The NHS response is to bully, intimidate, deny and either force the employee into silence or, if that fails, use your tax money to buy them off. All NHS managers/directors are incompetent, bullying, box-ticking shits. I am a died in the wool, old labour socialist - but, believe me, I would welcome the private sector into the NHS with open arms. Not even the very worst that Crapita or Serco could do would be worse than the current joke that comprises NHS 'management'. I am a relatively senior NHS manager, and with the exception of myself (obviously), every NHS manager I have come across is a complete fucking retard. All we do all day is sit around making pointless work for each other, falsifying our JD's to game the system and ruthlessly crushing any employee who dares suggest that we are anything less than perfect. The NHS is in crisis, largely down to the vast number of grossly overpaid piss-poor managers that you, the taxpayer, employs. Whistleblowers will not be listened to, no matter what lansley or anyone else says. The NHS are institutionalised bullies, and we're very good at it.Recommend?

LinkMetalDad13 December 2011 8:44PMHospitals should also not take an absence of complaints as proof of good service and user satisfaction.My father endured a long catalogue of screw ups, miscommunications and clinical errors, first by the social care staff, then by the hospital staff. In my opinon they made so many mistakes during a routine 48 hour stay for a minor op, that they made him weak enough to get "hospital acquired pneumonia" - and die from it. I was all for taking the fight to them. My siblings, who had endured more of the brunt of it, as they lived close by, just wanted to whole awful business to be over - so I bowed to their wishes.Normally when I suggest that the NHS could stand improvement, I get shouted down - because clearly it is proof that I want a US style, two-tier insurance based model - which I don't. But in many places it does need a kick up the backside in terms of petient dignity and care.I also have to ask what the government were doing about this for the last decade or so as this malaise took hold..?Recommend?

LinkXtofer13 December 2011 8:47PMResponse to drmavis, 13 December 2011 8:21PMI'm in a position to compare how things work in the medical device industry and how they work in the NHS. If you f+++ up in the NHS, stuff carries on because it has to: closing hospitals is a no-no. If you go wrong in the medical device industry, you're looking at total product recall and the likely closure of a facility until...I have done a fair bit of management in the NHS and, whilst I recognise a grain of truth in what you say, I have to wonder how much you have drunk before committing to keyboard. IMHO most of the problems in running the NHS arise from delivering rationing without making it explicit. This is not an NHS problem particularly: all healthcare systems have to meet boundless demand with a fixed pot.I don't have time to dig the figures up, but on most international indices, the NHS delivers good bang per buck. That's on a comparitively mediocre per capita buck. The NHS (like most first world health systems) is in crisis because of demographics, technological advance and the steady erosion of social contracts.Bullying is as endemic in the NHS as it is in any other industry in which I've worked (a few) and is more a function of national culture than anything else. Whistleblowers fare no better in those industries either.Recommend?

LinkXtofer13 December 2011 8:59PMResponse to dorice, 13 December 2011 7:47PMI enjoy your posts Dorice and generally agree with them. Certainly readmission rates are monitored (at last) which is a start. Survival rates or mortality rates are problematic. Some areas send a sicker person to hospital because deprivation is a function of geography and health is a function of deprivation (see Black report a few aeons ago). Also the money is not evenly spread.Beds is tricky. In principle you'd have about an 85% utilisation rate to cope with most eventualities in any ward. If you have a bunch of smallish hospitals with a bunch of specialisations, in a region, that gets expensive quickly (you have to staff the beds whether occupied or not). Add to that the impact of our demographic 'timebomb', which means that hospitals and services as they are currently configured, generally have a much older and sicker inpatient population than they were designed for. Interesting to note that the proportion of the population dying in hospital has risen significantly in the lifetime of the NHS, simply because that crisis 999 call is now more likely to be the last crisis. Difficult stuff to discuss and by no means an apologia for the Mid-Staffs crisis.Recommend?

LinkVraaak13 December 2011 10:05PMAnyone who thinks that you can just say when things are badly wrong in the NHS is deluded.Someone close to me saw some major things going wrong that shouldn't be - was able to get out in time but had to sign a non-disclosure agreement as part of the severance. I know a lot of people in the same situation. There are some powerful little hitlers out there who will destroy anyone who is out to speak the truth.The wastes of money aren't just from paying a few nurses too much overtime - it's blindingly obvious. And it's always the same few companies too. If I see one more polished granite pavement laid in a dead end between buildings where I work I'll let my dog go on it.and this is what's wrong with the public sector. Not too much funding, not too many managers, or all of the hackneyed tripe people come out with, it's corruption. Just as it often is in the private sector.Rout out the corruption at all levels and I bet public services will cost a third less with no sackings or pension cuts.Of course the private sector will do a lot less nicely out of it, and storage basements might have to make do with a bit less designer halogen lighting. .Recommend?

Linkcheckreakity14 December 2011 6:29AMYou have no chance. Time and time and time again you have seen the British system of have an inquiry to hide the problem. The British political system is one of insiders punishing those who dare interfere in their protected world. Why do you think Tories hate the EU so much?Inquries into the murder of cibvilians in Derry by British paratroopers protects the paratroopers. Inquiries into Iraq (isn't one still going on - bet those lawyers can afford good Cnristmas presents) protects the politicians and civil srvants who were grossly inept over Iraq. The inquiry into 400+ deaths at Mid-Staffs will punish no one. A nurse who photographed abuse gets the sack. Inquiries into deaths at Gosport, described by one inquiry as 'involuntary euthenasia' -ah, Britsh understatement, why not just say murder. Inquiries to protect the insiders in the NHS.Get the picture. Nigel Farage may think the UK is a thousand year old success story but anyone with intelligence (i.e. not UKIP and Tory voters) recognises it as s sytem based on patronage from a feudal monarchy.Recommend?

LinkBettyWindsor14 December 2011 7:55AMregardless of whistleblowers the "NHS system" protects the incompetentMy recent experince of the psychiatric geriatric ward of a hospital in the north Midlands was one of incompetent staff that kowtowed to an incompetent consultantthe issue was atypical antipsychotic medication given to a woman in her 80s with psychosis and dementia. I complained to the deputy ward manager that that this medication killed such patients. Her response? - "well you have to balance the risks & benefits". When I pointed out that the MHRA and the FDA had issued warnings about these drugs her response was "the FDA rulings only apply in America" - so drugs work differntly in the UK?The consultant listened less than the ward manager. I complained about the use of olanzapine in this patient - explaining in some detail my concerns. Her response? - she changed the medication to aripiprazole and then haloperidol - both just as bad. In a care meeting for this patient she stated "there was no scientific evidence to support my assertions"This type of negligence accounts for about 40% of "medication-error" related deaths in the NHS each yearIt's time to enforce "evidence based medicine" in the NHS and to diminish the power of consultantsRecommend?

Linkcolddebtmountain14 December 2011 8:05AMAll whistleblowers should be protected.No civilised society would hang someone out to dry just because they have revealed suspect, illegal, anti-trust etc practices in whatever workplace they happen to be employed. Often whistleblowing is the only weapon these people have against the unsavoury and unlawful practices that fill our "butter wouldn't melt in our mouths" ruling classes. If there is fraud at the bottom within our benefit systems then there is fraud at the top within the highest echelons, and, if it seriously neighbourly to rat on a benefit scrounger, then it is no different anywhere else.So while the Government are busy organising their designer cases against employees who have had the courage to speak out ministers should be aware that one day the same immoral tactics and practices may be used on them. It is not easy to be a whistleblower who is ostracised for doing the moral thing, and a civilised society should know it is wrong to persecute and malign them.Recommend?

LinkMetalDad14 December 2011 9:21AMResponse to Xtofer, 13 December 2011 9:09PMXtopher,Thanks for your comment. I do (usually) try to be respectful and I know the NHS is not just one monolithic entity.If you read my stuff, you'll know I have multiple things wrong with me so I see a lot of the inside of hospitals and clinics - and I'm at home with my leg bound after surgery even as we type. You'll also know I work as a management consultant to improve NHS, or ex-NHS, services and help them bid for contracts.This means I see a lot. I see some genius ideas and some great people - but their impact and their influence is always very limited because the system, as a whole, doesn't seem able to recognise, learn from or mainstream best or innovative practiceMy other lasting impression is of an unmanaged workforce. By this I mean there seem to be no standards of behaviour or attitude - or at least none that are either universally accepted or enforced by management. It is entirely dependent on chance if the next NHS person you deal with is pleasant, obstructive, dismissive, helpful or ignores you. That is not something that happens because of rationing or lack of money. It happens because of a lack of interest in staff management. Check which training courses in a trust or PCT have the lowest attendance - it will be staff management and customer care - at least it has been in the six I have checked to date.How can you have a PCT where you ring the switchboard and get an answerphone? How can you have hospitals that just don't answer their main number at all until it rings out? How can you have a clinic where the consultant calls all patients at the same time and tells you to expect to spend most of the day there as it takes him a long time to get through all these people? How can you have a registrar who is caught lying to you about your condition, and yet every follow up clinic - they try and make you see him again because they have fortgotten you asked not to deal with him - oh and nothing happens to the registrar as a result either.I know other industries need a kick up the pants too sometimes, but normally, their mistakes, their lack of attention to detail and their dismissive attitudes don't have quite such a drastic effect on people's lives.Xtopher - I'm quite prepared to believe that none of this applies to where you work and I only wish the whole NHS was like that...Recommend?

Linkdrmavis14 December 2011 10:32AMResponse to Xtofer, 13 December 2011 8:47PMYou make some good points here Xtofer. Admittedly I did have a spectacularly bad day dealing with the cretins at work yesterday. I, too have worked in the private sector for most of my career - I joined the NHS on a 1 year fixed term contract 7 years ago and I'm counting the days until March when I can leave this incompetent bunch of amateurs and go back to working with professionals again. One of my previous jobs was with a US bank, where bullying was actively encouraged - the more hostile the better. I was on the receiving end of a particularly nasty boss until I battered him senseless in the car park one day. I didn't get sacked, only got a verbal warning (and even that was for battering the guy on company premises). However, the big difference is that in the NHS, the culture of covering up for incompetence and bullying whistleblowers can lead to people dying. Big, big difference. Agree with you about the value for money aspect as well. In general, the medical staff are superb in the NHS, and do a brilliant job to the best of their ability. It's the non-medical side that needs shaking up and preferably kicking into touch. Unfotunately, that's the side I work on. The 'Dr' in my title comes from a DPhil, (I'm not a medical doctor), and yet I'm told my doctorate is useless in the NHS, because I haven't been on the NHS 3 day course in my subject. When I wearily ask to go on the NHS course I'm told I don't need to because of my academic qualifications. This has resulted in my utterly clueless boss attempting to tell me how to do aspects of my job which he hasn't got the mental capacity to understand. I could run rings around the joker in my sleep, but when I point out the stupid mistakes he's making I get told that I 'don't understand the ethos of the NHS'. The trouble is, I do. Roll on March.Recommend?

LinkXtofer14 December 2011 10:45AM@MetalDad - thanks for your thoughtful response. Point. No ownership of even basic stuff, like keeping waiting areas tidy. Sadly, I can only agree with you about the randomness of the attitudes you encounter.@drmavis - thank you for a measured response. One of my abiding impressions is the Berlin Wall which seems to exist (maybe just in my mind) between clinical and managerial staff. The greatest bee in my bonnet is the lack of grasp that there is a managerial body of knowledge and skill set, and there are better and worse practitioners. It's as if the only knowledge that counts is clinical training and to hell with any skills which are needed to ensure that the right patients turn up in front of the right doctors, with the right notes at the right time.I could go on, but duty calls.PS, to all.

LinkQueenoftheEast14 December 2011 11:11AMExcellent report on Channel 4 news last night - How is it that Ealing Hospital Trust can refuse to reinstate a medical professional despite being ordered to do so by an employment tribunal? And how can health minister Anne Hilton then claim that tighter legislation is not required, simply a change in 'culture'?NHS Trusts seem to be a law unto themselves.Recommend?

Linkdrmavis14 December 2011 11:33AM@ Xtofer- again good points. Agree about the clinical training, but I would expand it to include all NHS training. The only knowledge that counts is NHS training, and if you haven't slept through the relevant NHS courses, then any academic qualifications/prior experience count for nothing.When I leave the NHS I had intended to set up a blog about my 7 years NHS experience. My wife advised me not to - not on legal grounds, she's a lawyer (for a very aggressive law firm) and has offered to 'libel-proof' anything I write. Her advice was based on her serious doubt that anyone would believe me.Recommend?

Linkcymraeg14714 December 2011 12:17PMMy mother was abused by one nurse during a recent stay in the University of Wales Hospital, Llandough.We complained and complained. We concluded that the complaints procedure at the hospital trust was mere window dressing. Little wonder so many go the courts to claim compensation. It appears to be one of the only ways to be heard.Recommend?

Linkflorian714 December 2011 3:57PM@drmavis 11.33am, I`d believe you.@cymraeg147, you have my sympathy, and I agree with you about the complaints procedure. I have been fortunate , in as much as the Ombudsman have taken my complaint on, but how I wish this had not been necessary(every day of my life)I have had "dealings" with "managers" a thoroughly soul destroying business.I fought my lonely little battle in order to shine some light onto how the hell things have come to this, and remain hopeful that my mothers death may bring some positive changes. I can but hope.As someone earlier said, this is peoples lives we are talking about.When I first complained to the hospital after her death, I might as well have been talking about an incorrect gas bill, that was how it felt, the kind of mind-numbing, red tape, pass the buck kind of language they used. This is why I have so much respect for the consultant I mentioned in my previous post.Recommend?
