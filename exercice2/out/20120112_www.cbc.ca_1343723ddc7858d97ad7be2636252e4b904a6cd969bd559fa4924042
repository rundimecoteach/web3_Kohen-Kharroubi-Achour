The average survival rate has increased, however.The report also shows the four most common cancers diagnosed in the city — female breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancer — are not unlike most other areas. But Ottawa does have a lower rate of both prostate and cervical cancer diagnoses than the rest of Ontario.For men, the most common cancers were prostate, colorectal, lung and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The most deadly of male cancers were lung, colorectal, prostate and pancreatic cancers.For women, cancer was most prevalent in the breast, lung, colon and body of the uterus. The most deadly were lung, breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers.Overall, survival rates have increased in the city between five-year periods of 1993-1997 and 2003-2007.The data is about five years old so the report warns the information "may not be a truly representative picture of the current burden of cancer in Ottawa."You can read the full report here, which will be presented to the Ottawa Board of Health on Jan. 16.Share ToolsReport TypoSend FeedbackStay Connected with CBC NewsMobileFacebookPodcastsTwitterAlertsNewsletterBig Box AdvertisementLatest Ottawa News HeadlinesQuebec mom charged in daughter's death attempts suicideA western Quebec woman charged with first-degree murder in the death of her seven-year-old daughter is in hospital in critical condition after attempting suicide. more »Kanata commuters fuming after bus no-showCommuters who work in a Kanata industrial park say they are furious after an OC Transpo bus scheduled to drive by their workplace has left them stranded two days in a row. more »Shafia mom says teen's photos not a 'dishonour'The Montreal mother accused in the deaths of her three daughters and her husband's first wife has testified that photos of one of the girls in revealing clothing was not a dishonour to her. more »Hospital researchers upset over Ontario funding cutsScientists in Ottawa say Ontario's decision to cut $66 million in health research funding is a blow to cancer and heart-disease treatment work in Canada. more »Ottawa mayor says Senate should be abolishedJust days after police chief Vern White's appointment to the Senate, Ottawa mayor Jim Watson said he would abolish the Upper House. more »Most RecentWatchListenShow previous slideShow next slideShow previous slideShow next slideTop News HeadlinesSyria protests continue against defiant AssadAnti-government protesters rallied for another night on the outskirts of Damascus, hours after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad made a surprise appearance at a pro-regime rally in the city centre, where he again vowed to end the months-long revolt against his rule.more »Afghan president condemns U.S. marines urination videoAfghan President Hamid Karzai condemns a video depicting what appears to be four U.S. marines urinating on the corpses of Taliban fighters, calling the apparent actions "completely inhumane" and demanding that the U.S. military punish the marines. more »RCMP spied on Bob Rae in 1960sNewly declassified documents reveal the RCMP spied on Bob Rae during his student activist days and likely amassed a personal file on the future interim Liberal leader. more »Haiti's struggle to build better homes after quakeInnovative building technology is one hope for the future in Haiti, where more than 500,000 people still live in temporary camps two years after a devastating earthquake. more »U.K. spies won't face charges for Guantanamo tortureAgents working for Britain's spy agencies won't face criminal charges over their alleged complicity in the mistreatment of former Guantanamo detainees, the country's top prosecutor says. more »More Headlines »Most Viewed/CommentedMost ViewedCommentedKanata commuters fuming after bus no-showQuebec mom charged in daughter's death attempts suicideOttawa school bus cancellationsOttawa man selling Lego Stephen HarperShafia mom says teen's photos not a 'dishonour'Ottawa mayor says Senate should be abolishedCivic hospital security guard charged with sexual assaultHospital researchers upset over Ontario funding cutsFormer bank renamed after Sir John A.
