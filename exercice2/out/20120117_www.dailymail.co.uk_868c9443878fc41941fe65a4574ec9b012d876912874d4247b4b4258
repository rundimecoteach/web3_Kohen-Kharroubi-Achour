Daily Mail ReporterLast updated at 2:16 PM on 17th January 2012Comments (5)ShareHealth officials are to face questions about whether they prescribed Tamiflu on a mass scale too quickly in the wake of the 2009 swine flu outbreak.A two-year review into the widely prescribed drug will reveal findings about the effectiveness and side-effects of the swine flu 'wonder-drug'.The conclusions made by the Cochrane Collaboration could pose uncomfortable questions for the Department of Health as to whether they rushed into mass prescriptions of Tamiflu when swine flu hit the nation in 2009.Tamiflu was prescribed on a mass scale in 2009 following the nationwide outbreak of swinefluAs well as questioning issues surrounding Tamiflu, researchers behind the review also claimed the makers of the drug refused to hand over raw data to help them with their appraisal.Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche claimed Tamiflu reduced the number of patients who needed to be hospitalised after becoming infected with swine flu.More...Charities warn of NHS crisis over Parkinson's 'timebomb' as number of cases is set to riseCan female sex hormones beat brain damage? Doctors believe progesterone may have protective effectNutrition therapists condemned as 'quacks' who put patients' health at riskThe comprehensive appraisal by Cochrane, a non-profit group who analyse medical evidence through results from the world's best medical research studies, aims to challenge Roche's claim when its findings are released tomorrow.Cochrane Collaboration founder Sir Iain Chalmers said Tamiflu makers Roche 'refused to provide data'The Cochrane Collaboration, considered by experts to be the 'gold standard' of medical evidence, also reported problems obtaining data from Roche back in 2009.Professor Sir Iain Chalmers, a founder of the Cochrane Collaboration, told The Bureau of Investigative Journalism: 'We have invested millions of pounds on stockpiling Tamiflu on the basis of a paper that presented the results of 12 trials, only two of which have been published.'The investigation... shows Roche refused to provide data to evaluate these trials.'Investigators got some data through the European Medicines Agency, but this doesn't answer all of the questions they have.'He added: 'It is a disgrace that Roche have not provided this data.'Roche responded by saying it has provided Cochrane with access to 3,200 pages of detailed information as part of their review.TAMIFLU - Wonder cure of dangerous drug?Tamiflu is a medicine which is used to prevent and treat
influenza. It was discovered in 1999, by Gilead Sciences, a Californian biotech
company set up by doctor Michael Riordan in 1987 and is manufactured by Roche.The influenza virus gets into the body through the mouth or
nose. It replicates itself in the cells lining the airways. The viruses then
spread to more and more cells making the infection more serious.Tamiflu blocks the effects of a chemical called
neuraminidase that is made by the influenza virus, which it uses to spread. So
the sooner it is taken after symptoms develop the better the chance of warding
off the worst effects of flu.This makes it easier for the body's immune system to
clear-up the infection.It can cause side-effects, although not everyone will
experience them.'The most common ones are nausea, vomiting and stomach ache,'
says GP Wendy Denning of London's the Health Doctors clinic. 'Tamiflu should be
taken after food. However, if a person is sick within an hour of taking it, it
is likely to be ineffective.'Roche revised the Tamiflu patient information warning that
it can cause hallucinations, delirium or abnormal behaviour, which sometimes
'results in fatal outcomes'.This was after the Japanese government warned doctors in
March 2007 that Tamiflu should not be prescribed to teenagers for fear that it
can lead to bizarre and self-destructive behaviour, after investigating the
deaths of 18 Japanese children.The Swiss firm said it made full clinical study data available to health authorities as part of the licensing process.A spokesperson for Roche said today: 'Roche stands behind the robustness and integrity of our data supporting the efficacy and safety of Tamiflu.'Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche said they 'stand by the robustness and integrity of our data'A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'At the end of last year we published a major review of the scientific evidence base, which showed a clear benefit in offering antivirals to those with severe illness and those with additional risk factors.'Our priority has always been to minimise the risk of serious illness and death from seasonal flu.'Share this article:FacebookTwitterGoogle+MessengerLinkedInDigg itNewsvineFarkNowpublicRedditPrint articleEmail articleAdd your commentsComments (5)Here's what other readers have said.

When countries didn't want it BIG PHARMA tried to offload it to smaller countries for less cash so that they could make their money BACK. Check out RECOMBINOMICS. Bird is breaking out in Egypt with all sorts of combos H1N1/H3N2/H5N1. Seems very suspicious if you ask me. Notice there is nothing in the news about these outbreaks in other countries. That's because big pharma knows that people over here aren't falling for the hype and have wizened up. Nowadays the big push is to get all girls VACCINATED for the human papillomavirus. Read about the side effects. Next they'll have a vaccination for smokers/fat people/ugly people/etc.. Where does it all stop? NO MORE VACCINES!- Dee, UK, 17/1/2012 15:14Click to rateRating
3Report abuseWhat a load of bull, the big pharmas are making a fortune out of us, prescribing everything for nothing, a lot of ailments could be aided by change of food intake and exercise, but we all rather run to the doic for a quick fix, its up to us as a nation to stop taking the poills and start to look after ourselves in a much healthier life style,- Angel Of Jah, London, 17/1/2012 14:29Click to rateRating

21Report abuseSCAM!!! This was just another set of lies to spread fear to the masses. News headlines were all saying millions were going to die and so on. Utter garbage. It was a total con-job and the politicians, health dept. and the big pharma representatives that were part of this should be held accountable and jailed for wasting MILLIONS of tax-payers money. Of course the good-old-boys club will all stick together and nothing will happen. Sickening.- Alan, Right here, right now, 17/1/2012 13:50Click to rateRating
