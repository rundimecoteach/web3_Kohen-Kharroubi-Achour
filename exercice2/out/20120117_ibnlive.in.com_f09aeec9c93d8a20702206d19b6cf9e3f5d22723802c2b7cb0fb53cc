the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, has reached
Mumbai to ascertain facts about the reported cases of Drug
Resistant TB cases.
The Ministry says, the cases should be called
'Extensively Drug Resistant-TB' (XDR-TB) and not 'Totally Drug
Resistant TB' (TDR-TB) as per WHO norms, an official release
said.
The central team has started analysis of the situation
and is in touch with the health authorities of Maharashtra,
Mumbai Municipal Corporation, while also involving experts
from concerned stake-holders, including the Hinduja Hospital,
Mumbai.
Hinduja hospital is not accredited to diagnose XDR or
TDR, the release said. "So far as the report from Hinduja
Hospital is concerned, this Hospital Laboratory is not
accredited by the Revised National Tuberculosis Control
Programme, for culture and sensitivity for second line drugs
to diagnose Extensively Drug-Resistant (XDR)/Totally Drug
Resistant (TDR) cases and is only accredited for conducting
Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST) by liquid culture and
sensitivity for first line drug only," it said.
Recently, a proposal for accreditation of Line Probe
Assay test (LPA) has been received and is under process, it
added.
As of now, the Revised National TB Control Programme
has accredited only following three labs for conducting
quality-assured second-line anti-TB drug susceptibility
testing of flouroquinolones and injectables: National TB
Institute (NTI), Bangalore; LRS Institute of TB and Chest
Disease, New Delhi, and National Institute of Research in
Tuberculosis, Chennai. (More) PTI VT
