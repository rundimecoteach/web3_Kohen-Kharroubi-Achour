> NewsBronx Man Gets $40 Million Hospital Bill, Nearly Has Asthma AttackComments1By STEPHANIE TSOFLIASpix11.com6:23 p.m. EST, January 16, 2012Alex Rodriquez, of the Bronx, keeps an inhaler for emergencies and last week, he needed it.The 28-year-old unemployed, ex-doorman says doctors at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital cured him of pneumonia. But last week when he received a bill in the mail for the hospital's services, he felt ill again."I almost had an asthma attack," Rodriquez told PIX 11 News. The bill was for $44,776,587."When i saw 44 million, I thought it had to be a mistake," said Rodriquez.Alex said he is unemployed and doesn't have insurance so he expected a hefty bill. The hospital estimated he would have to pay $40,000 in installments and the first bill was only supposed to be for a couple of hundred."The union took away my insurance then I got sick," he said.When he saw the bill, he immediately called the billing firm, PHY services, and got an automated message that said the invoice was a mistake. And that the computer accidentally swapped the invoice number with the "amount due."Rodriquez spoke with a customer representative who said they had received hundreds of calls. PHY services told him they would send a new bill and an apology letter."People make mistakes, system errors, computer errors. Someone should check the bill," said Rodriquez.Copyright © 2012, WPIX-TVwpix-hospital-patient-gets-40-million-billComments1« Previous StoryMore NewsNext Story »Jailed Man Hospitalized After Allegedly Smuggling 10-inch Pistol In Rectum5-year old Accused of Stabbing 3 in Juice Box DisputeComments (1)Add / View comments | Discussion FAQpos jag at 9:39 PM January 16, 2012I WOULDVE SENT IT BACK AND TOLD THEM TO KISS MY BEHIND.POPULAR PIXNo Pants NYC Subway Ride 2012Celebrity Cleavage ChallengePictures: Scared of SantaGuess Whose Assets?Faces Of Meth: Before And AfterMost Infamous Celebrity Sex TapesNYC Holiday Pix 2011PHOTOS: Nicki Minaj's Booty, Too Good To Be True?Favorite Celebs Without EyebrowsMost Shocking Celeb Nude Photo Scandals (NSFW)Top StoriesViral VideosWeb BonusTownhouse Blown To Bits; 2 Firefighters Blown Back 30 FeetSuspects On The Run After L.I.
