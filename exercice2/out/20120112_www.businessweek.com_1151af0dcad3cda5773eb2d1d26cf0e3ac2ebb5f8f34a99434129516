Out of nearly 11 million participants in races of 13.1 miles (21.1 kilometers) to 26.2 miles, they identified 59 runners who suffered a cardiac arrest.While reports of heart complications and sudden death after long races have risen in recent years, the increase stems from a greater number of participants, the investigators said. The overall danger is low, particularly compared with the risk seen in college sports, triathlons, and among previously overweight middle-age joggers, the New England Journal of Medicine report found.“The risk associated with long-distance running events is equivalent to or lower than the risk associated with other vigorous physical activity,” said the researchers, led by Jonathan Kim from Massachusetts General Hospital’s division of cardiology. About one-fourth of runners who suffered a cardiac arrest survived, probably because onlookers started giving CPR and portable defibrillators were available to shock the heart back into rhythm, they said.The study detected an increase in heart risks among men who were running the longest distances. The finding is troubling and suggests more high-risk men who may already have early heart disease may be taking up running to get into shape, the researchers said.--Editors: Reg Gale, Angela ZimmTo contact the reporter on this story: Michelle Fay Cortez in Minneapolis at mcortez@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Reg Gale at rgale5@bloomberg.netBusiness ExchangeE-mailPrintREADER DISCUSSIONSponsored LinksBuy a link now!Most Popular ContentReadE-mailedDiscussedSlide ShowsThree Types of People to Fire ImmediatelyTop B-School Stories of 2011Lego Is for GirlsTransocean: No Apologies Over Gulf Oil SpillIt's Always Sunny in Silicon ValleyRSS Feed: Most Read StoriesThree Types of People to Fire ImmediatelyWhich Is America's Best City?Lego Is for GirlsTop B-School Stories of 2011Professional Women and a Secure RetirementRSS Feed: Most E-mailed StoriesKorea's Next Challenge: Global CompetitivenessRSS Feed: Most Discussed StoriesThe 20 Biggest Casinos2006 Best Global BrandsOlympic ArchitectureBest Young Tech Entrepreneurs 2009Steve Jobs, 1955-2011RSS Feed: Most Popular Slide ShowsSlide Show2012 Range Rover EvoqueSpecial ReportCEO Guide to 3-D PrintingVideoPrivate Equity Firms Create Jobs, Rogers SaysSlide ShowTen Products Printed in 3DSpecial ReportFocus On Entrepreneurs, November 2011Video1/10: The Start of CES, Detroit Auto ShowPost a JobJobsBusiness Development jobsDesign jobsEntertainment jobsEnvironmental jobsExecutive jobsHealthcare jobsLegal jobsManagement jobsMarketing jobsReal Estate jobsRetail jobsSales jobsView all jobsSimplyHiredRelated topics inRisk ManagementSocial Media in the WorkplaceWomen in Business SchoolWomen in LeadershipInvesting in TechnologyPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.Special ReportsFix This/TransportationCrisis in JapanHealth CareSentiment AnalysisMore Special ReportsBusiness ToolsB-School ComparisonB-School CalendarBW for MobileE-mail NewslettersRSSWhite PapersA-Z IndexBW AuthorsBX TopicsPrivate CompaniesPublic CompaniesLists & RankingsBest Global BrandsBest Places to Launch a CareerBest Providers of Customer ServiceBest Undergraduate Business SchoolsBusiness School Rankings & ProfilesBW 50: Best Performing CompaniesTop 100 IT CompaniesMost Innovative CompaniesFollow Us@BW on TwitterBW on FacebookBlogsEconoChatEuroCrisisJoshua Green on PoliticsOccupy Wall StreetSmall BusinessTechnology[+] Rate this pageSlideshow GalleryAutosBusiness SchoolsDesignInternationalInnovationInvestingManagingPolicyReal EstateSmall BusinessTechnologyMagazineCurrent IssueSubscribe NowBloombergAboutAdvertisingCustom PublishingEDGE ProgramsReprintsTerms of UseDisclaimerPrivacy NoticeEthics CodeContact UsSite Map©2012 Bloomberg L.P.
