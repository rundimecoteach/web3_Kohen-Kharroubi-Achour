We area all delighted."Peter Gordon, the chairman of Glenfiddich and the great-nephew of Ms Roberts, said: "My great-aunt has witnessed great change at the Glenfiddich distillery over the past 110 years, so it seems fitting to honour her remarkable life in this way."In November 2010 a 64-year-old single malt sold for almost £300,000 at auction in New York, but the price included a special decanter.More on This StoryRelated StoriesWhisky fetches more than £25,00016 JUNE 2010,
