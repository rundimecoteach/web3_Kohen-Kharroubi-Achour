RSSPolice seek more sexual victims of HIV-infected manÂÂPostmedia NewsJanuary 11, 2012ÂTweetÂPolice are seeking more victims of a Toronto-area man who they say had sexual relations with women without disclosing he was HIV-positive.York Regional Police on Wednesday issued a picture of Sarbjit Singh Mann, 39, of Stouffville, Ont., who was charged this week with aggravated sexual assault and criminal negligence.Authorities have identified one person they say is one of the accused's victims and are hoping the photo will prompt more to come forward."We don't know how many victims there are" said Sgt. Gary Phillips of the York police. "That's the purpose of putting (the photo) out."HIV is a virus that often progresses to give people the deadly AIDS disease.Dr. Julio Montaner, director of the B.C. Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, recently wrote in the Canadian Medical Association Journal that it should not be a crime for HIV-infected people to withhold their condition to sexual partners.He argued that advances in medicine have made it possible to "virtually eliminate" the risk of transmitting HIV to another person through sex.Â© Copyright (c) Postmedia NewsÂÂÂE-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleShare this ArticleÂÂÂÂLocation refreshedÂStory ToolsÂE-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleÂFont:*****ÂImage:****ÂÂÂRelated Stories from Around the WebAfrican-themed Canadian style in museum exhibitÂDaily News, HalifaxÂWednesday, January 11, 2012Brian Francis: The men with AIDSÂThe AfterwordÂWednesday, August 24, 2011The KPMG report: Close libraries, sell the zoo, cut back on policeÂPosted TorontoÂThursday, July 21, 2011ÂÂÂRelated TopicsTorontoContagious and Infectious DiseasesHealth and FitnessMost Popular NewsMost ReadE-mailedCommentedPizza: Old-school pies made perfectFormer Montreal Canadiens head scout Caron remembered for Wickenheiser pickResidents to raise issue of supervised injection sites at Ville Marie council meetingFitness: Diet is less important than being active'Thoughtful' St-Denis jumps to LiberalsFunds dry up for MTL Punk director Ãrik CimonÂmore Â»
