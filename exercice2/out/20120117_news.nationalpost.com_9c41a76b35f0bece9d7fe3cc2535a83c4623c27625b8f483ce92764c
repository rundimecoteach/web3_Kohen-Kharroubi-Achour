The "Rue" was taped on.CommentsEmailTwitterOTTAWA — The requirement for bilingualism at the federal and provincial level costs governments $2.4-billion per year, according to a new report from the Fraser Institute.Of that, the federal government is spending $1.5-billion, while the provinces spend $900-million — $623-million of that is in Ontario, the highest spending province.“The issue we examine in this study is not whether bilingualism is good or bad policy, but the costs above and beyond that of providing education and other services in the majority language,” Universite de Montreal economics professor Francois Vaillancourt said in a statement.The study, titled Official Language Policies of the Canadian Provinces: Costs and Benefits, breaks down the costs associated with providing services in the minority language in each province — French through most of the country and English in Quebec.According to the study’s authors, the annual cost for providing bilingual services is centred around French-language training.While Ontario spends the most of bilingual services, New Brunswick, Canada’s only officially bilingual province, spends the second most annually at $85 million.Quebec rounds out the top three with an annual bilingual cost of $50 million.The study concludes that provinces with large francophone populations could reduce spending on services by contracting them out and instituting a user pay system.Postmedia NewsRelatedFrench first, English second: N.B. town Dieppe issues $100 fines for breaking signage bylawTwitter and Facebook guidelines: Tweet in both official languages, report tells N.B. civil servants‘If you’re Canadian, why aren’t you bilingual?’ new immigrants wonderThe bilingualism debate: A shift away from frenchPosted in:Canada, NewsTags:BilingualismPostmedia NewsTori Stafford family steels itself for emotional trial of man accused of murdering eight-year-oldDelaying parenthood has serious medical risks for both men and women, study warnsForeign-backed groups trying to delay pipeline hearings: HarperMatthew Fisher: Canada loses one of its greatest friends in AfghanistanCosta Concordia disaster sounds alarm on cruise industry issues, expert saysMore from Postmedia News »http://www.jacksnewswatch.com/2012/01/16/afternoon-update-jabuary-16th-2012-10/ Afternoon Update Jabuary 16th, 2012 (10) | Jack's Newswatch[...] #4 — NP | Bilingual requirement for government costs $2.4-billion per year OTTAWA — The requirement for bilingualism at the federal and provincial level costs governments $2.4-billion per year, according to a new report from the Fraser Institute.
