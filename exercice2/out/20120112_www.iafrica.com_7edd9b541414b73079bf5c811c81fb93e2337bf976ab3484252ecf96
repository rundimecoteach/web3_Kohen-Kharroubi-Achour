It seems Japan has adopted one of the West's nasty four-lettered words with great gusto, using it to describe anything that's really fantastic.A New Yorker says he is to blame for this recent phenomenon. Owner and chef for a restaurant chain called Bubby's, Ron Silver was in Yokohama, Japan in 2009 setting up a branch of the restaurant there when he insisted on fresh produce. According to Silver, the Japanese use a lot of frozen goods and in his frustration to explain fresh to his staff, he ranted at them, "I mean f**king fresh, man."The following day, his staff asked him whether by fresh he meant canned, which started him ranting again, " What do you not understand about f**ing fresh?"According to the original report on Gawker.com, Silver's staff may have been teasing him the whole time as they soon decorated the Bubby's logo with the slogan, "f***kin fresh".So catchy is it, that it's become the unofficial slogan of the Osaka branch, written on the menus and adverts, like "F**kin Fresh & Delicious food" and "Bubby's F**kin Fresh lemonade" — dropping the "g" seems a popular spelling of the word.Now, it seems, the new-found adjective has been adopted elsewhere, with signs advertising a "f**kin sale" in Osaka, Japan, recently reported by Gawker.com.Whether or not the phrase originated at Bubby's, one thing is for certain, the Japanese have a certain way with the English language.MORE FEATURESStick to your resolutionsIt's not always easy sticking to those New Year's resolutions, so here are a few tips that might help.Win a hamper with Windhoek!Windhoek Lager is giving away five fantastic hampers that include a mini braai, draught glasses and more!Cheers to a good sex lifeResearch shows that women who enjoy a drink or two daily also report satisfaction with their sex lives.USER COMMENTS: >Contact usFeedbackAdvertisingServicesAbout usNewslettersCopyright Â© 2002-2012 iafrica.com, a division of Primedia Online* - a Primedia companyReproduction without permission is prohibited.
