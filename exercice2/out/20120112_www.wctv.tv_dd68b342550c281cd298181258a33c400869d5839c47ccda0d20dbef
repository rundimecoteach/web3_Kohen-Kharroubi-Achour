These nonprofit organizations contract with the state to handle all prevention, foster care, adoption and Independent Living services to children and families in the child welfare system. The Scorecard will be updated monthly and evaluate the lead agencies on 12 key measures to determine how well they are meeting the most critical needs of these at-risk children.“Florida’s system of community-based care has become a national model over the past decade,” said Department Secretary David Wilkins. “This tool will allow the sharing of best practices and ensure proven successful methods are being used statewide to further improve child safety and well-being.”The scorecard will measure the lead agencies across each indicator, including child safety, family preservation, adoptions, and well-being of children in foster care such as medical and dental services and educational goals.“As providers, the community-based care system is one of the most closely monitored and evaluated systems in the state, perhaps in the country even,"said Mike Cusick, FCC president and CEO. "Our goal in working to develop this scorecard with DCF is to ensure that the measures highlight areas where we are succeeding, while identifying areas of improvement to ensure the system achieves its ultimate goal of keeping kids safe and building strong families."The Scorecard and an explanation of the measurements are available online at http://www.dcf.state.fl.us/programs/cbc/cbcaccountability.shtmlLatest CommentsPosted by: Random Government employee on Jan 11, 2012 at 05:42 PMA new menas to tabulate how much more money they can ask for next year because as everyone knows the only way to improve child protection in Florida is to throw more money at it when it is failing to succeed.Click here to post or read all 1 comments.More StoriesCity Commission Names New Treasurer-ClerkFSU's National Hero TributeNew Poll Suggests Close Race Between Obama and GOP Nominee in FL[UPDATE]: Man Faces 25 to Life for Tallahassee ShootingActivists: Farmers Don't Take My Kodachrome AwayMARTA ShootingFlorida voting beginsFlorida Management Director DiesMost ViewedMost PopularMost CommentedStudent Stabbed on TCC's CampusVideo Voyeurism?
