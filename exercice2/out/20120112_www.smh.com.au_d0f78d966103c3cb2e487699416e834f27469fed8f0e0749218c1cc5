It provides the first direct evidence of how alcohol makes people feel good.''Researchers took scans on the brains of 13 heavy drinkers and 12 non-drinkers after they had alcohol. Their findings, published in the Science Translational Medicine journal, showed alcohol caused endorphins to be released in the nucleus accumbens and orbitofrontal cortex brain regions.with Telegraph, LondonJoin the conversation14 people are reading this now.TweetTop World articlesWith head bowed, 'pathological liar' admits to killing racing driver's daughter, but five years on, disappearance of teen remains unsolvedWhy Guantanamo still weighs heavily on America's conscienceBumbling transplant team drop donor heart on pavementJapan's first jailbreak in 22 years: on the run in his underwear in 4 degreesDying Aussie's call to 911: 'I've been shot through a vein in my leg'More World articlesStory ToolsShare on FacebookEmail this storyPrint this storyReprints & permissionsSMH JobsAdvertisementLatest VideoWorld News Video More videoClick to play videoAmish group plead not guilty to attacksTwelve members of a breakaway Amish group in Ohio have pleaded not guilty to beard-cutting attacks.Click to play videoSteve Jobs lives on in comic bookClick to play videoFuel subsidy protests rock NigeriaClick to play videoVan der Sloot pleads guilty to murderAdvertisementFeatured advertisersSponsored linksSpecial offers Powered by MozoView these special offers by Mozo.AdvertisementAdvertisementReal EstateVet pleads for landlords to allow petsDomain.com.auBuy real estateGet a FREE suburb profileWhat is your house worth?MotoringNew Cars for 2012Drive.com.auGreat Aussie Road TripSell your car easilyFind us on FacebookEssential BabyBeyonce's quirky baby nameEssentialbaby.com.auOvulation calculatorBaby namesDue Date CalculatorHolidaysRelax in your home away from homeRent-a-home.com.auShort-term accommodationSydney holiday rentalsSearch 27,000+ holiday propertiesManaged FundsWant to become a millionaire?Investsmart.com.auCheck out InvestSMART on Facebook6.00% + On Savings Accounts!5.90% Term Deposit!Compare and SaveSkip to:Best DealsMobileBroadbandCredit CardsRewards CardsLow Rate CardsHome LoansDepositsBank AccountsLoansCheck out today's best dealsFree flight + 0% offerPlus 25,000 bonus points from American ExpressCheck it out >>>0.99% for 12 monthsSt George Vertigo: 0.99% balance transfers for 12 monthsCheck it out >>>Online Home LoanLimited time offer -
