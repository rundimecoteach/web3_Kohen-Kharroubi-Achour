Encouraging healthier ways of coping with boredom could include education or providing healthy snacks and drinks in canteens.'TweetWhat would you like to say?To add a YouTube video, insert its web address hereSendto Metro and share on:NewestOldestMost PopularLeast PopularRelated itemsAlcohol is more appealing when loud music is playing, claims new researchSex gets better with age, say US researchersFamilies' loan debts eat up half of income, says new researchRock the week filesModern Warfare 3: Rock the week MoreRugby World Cup: Rock the Week MoreCelebrity Big Brother 2011: Rock The Week MoreClapham's broom army: Rock the Week MoreCesc Fabregas transfer saga: Rock the Week MoreReading and Leeds Festival 2011: Rock The Week More5 day forecast | Local WeatherFor your iPad: Metro tablet edition launchedMetro has launched its first interactive version of the newspaper designed especially for the iPad - and it's free...Our choiceMost readWayne Rooney outclassed on FIFA 12 by world championThis Morning's Holly Willoughby left red-faced after naughty cheese mix-upEmma Watson snuggles up to mystery man as he plants a kiss on her cheekLee Steele sacked by Oxford City over Gareth Thomas homophobic tweetGraduate told to work for free or lose benefitsIn their words: Scottish debateRoald Dahl celebrated with stampsRandy the ram sires 33 lambs in 24hrsNudist shock in kids' clothing advertVinnie Jones on how to perform CPRMetro
