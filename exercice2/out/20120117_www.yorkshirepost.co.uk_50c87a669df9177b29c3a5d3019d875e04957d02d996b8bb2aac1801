This clearly undermines the credibility of its work.”The RCN wants the CQC to report specifically on staffing levels during its inspections, including the ratio of registered nurses to other staff.It should also develop an appropriate tool to determine staffing levels and nurse-to-patient ratios, it said.Furthermore, the CQC should also ensure all providers have an unannounced inspection once a year and inspectors should speak to staff – both junior and senior – without managers present so staff can speak freely.Dr Carter said: “There is no doubt that nurses and healthcare assistants support the need for an effective regulator.”Email to a friendPrint this pageLogged in as:Comment here.Please adhere to our Community guidelinesYour viewPlease sign in to be able to comment on this story.Top storiesTaxpayer faces huge bill to save ‘digital revolution’Leeds double murder: Schools left to mourn teacher and her little girlVideo: 12 job seekers for every vacancy in urban YorkshireSex fiend who fled bail hostel murdered woman, 95, in Bradford care homeMan for all seasons: Hockney’s new exhibition of Yorkshire landscapes knocked up on an iPadNewsAt a GlanceNational NewsFeaturesAround YorkshireDebateCountry ViewLive Traffic CamsShowbizInternationalCommunityView Print EditionsPublic & Legal NoticesAt a GlanceMain SectionEducationPoliticsElectionsloading...PopularMost commentsMost sharedDelph is looking set for return to LeedsWindow Shopping (January 17): Who wants who in January?Video: Girl of four ‘was alone for hours’ in Leeds house of horrorLlera sure Owls can hunt down leaders CharltonNow eurozone’s bailout fund downgradedLibrary lessonSex fiend who fled bail hostel murdered woman, 95, in Bradford care homeTest mast plans submitted for proposed wind farm siteHarry Mead: Don’t deface the jewel of our coastline by putting a potash mine near Robin Hood’s BayMortgages most affordable for 14 years, claims HalifaxMystery remains over bank worker’s death fall at officeHow to survive life after redundancy: How can you improve your job search strategy?Fred AndrewsAlarm over temporary workers’ rightsRecycling drive spills on to the streetsSearch for:
