"What is the best way to disseminate information to the people affected by it? And the best way is not through Twitter."Badry said she didn't fall ill but four other Calgary students did when the outbreak hit during the conference gala."We were all dressed up and running outside and people were just vomiting everywhere," she said.Six out of 10 students from the Aquinian at St. Thomas University in Fredericton also got sick."While we haven't had it confirmed, we're pretty sure its Norwalk virus given how it presented and developed," said Suzanne Germain of the Vancouver Island Health Authority."We suspect a student, or a few students, contracted this somehow — it takes one to two days to incubate — then they travelled to the meeting, and then it spread quite rapidly among the student group."Noroviruses are found in the stool or vomit of infected people.People can become infected through direct contact with an infected person, by touching contaminated surfaces or objects, or by eating food or drinking water that has been contaminated.Symptoms usually last only 48 to 72 hours.The 74th NASH conference began Wednesday and ended Sunday in Victoria. It was hosted by the Martlet, the student newspaper at the University of Victoria, and the Nexus, the paper for students at Camosun College.Share ToolsReport TypoSend FeedbackStay Connected with CBC NewsMobileFacebookPodcastsTwitterAlertsNewsletterBig Box AdvertisementLatest New Brunswick News HeadlinesCitizens slam corporate tax cuts at budget meetingSaint John residents used a pre-budget meeting to criticize corporate tax breaks and financial incentives given to the province's largest businesses.more »Highfield Square's demise sparks development questionsHighfield Square's pending closure is causing many people in Moncton to question whether a new downtown multi-purpose centre could be built in the area. more »Saint John temporarily shelves city budgetSaint John councillors balked at passing the city's 2012 budget on Monday night, deferring the vote until after they view an alternate budget option. more »Proposed Moncton subdivision criticized over costsMoncton politicians will hold hearings in February on whether they allow a new 1,400-home subdivision near the Royal Oaks Golf Course. more »Saint John homeless in the coldSaint John needs more emergency shelter services for the homeless during the winter, say advocates. more »Most RecentWatchListenShow previous slideShow next slideShow previous slideShow next slideTop News HeadlinesNavy officer accused of spying forgoes bail bidA Canadian navy intelligence officer charged with communicating information to a foreign entity or terrorist group has agreed to stay in custody for now and not make a bail application, his lawyer says. more »Italian cruise ship wreck yields 5 more bodiesRescue workers discover five more bodies in an Italian cruise ship wreck, raising the death toll to 11, as a recording shows its captain made excuses when asked to reboard. more »Central bank stands pat with 1% rateThe Bank of Canada held its target for the overnight interest rate steady at 1.0 per cent, the 11th consecutive time it has chosen to do so. more »Harper says pipeline debate should be left to CanadiansPrime Minister Stephen Harper believes decisions on expanding pipelines should be made by Canadians, he told CBC chief correspondent Peter Mansbridge during an interview. more »Iris implants threaten visionUsing surgical implants to change eye colour can rob people of their vision, some Canadian eye specialists warn. more »More Headlines »Most ViewedMost CommentedCitizens slam corporate tax cuts at budget meetingPetitcodiac area detour upsets residentsSaint John homeless in the coldProposed Moncton subdivision criticized over costsArmy reservists fight cold in BathurstInjured Moncton pedestrian diesMaterials salvaged from old conventSaint John temporarily shelves city budgetControversial blogger pleads guilty to disturbance chargeEvents »Information Morning Amateur Comedy contestStand and Deliver your best routine!
