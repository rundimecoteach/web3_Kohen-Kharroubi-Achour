Though by no means widespread, the practice is carried out by some immigrants to Canada, Kale says.His editorial cites a small U.S. study of about 65 immigrant Indian women that found 40 per cent had terminated earlier pregnancies, and 89 per cent pursued abortions in their most recent pregnancies after learning they were having girls. Previous Canadian research has suggested that sex selection is occurring in Canada in certain groups when families have had girls and are seeking a son.The practice has created a gender imbalance in these communities.A CMAJ editorial calls for gender disclosure policies at 30 weeks to be adopted by the provincial colleges that govern doctors. (CBC)"A pregnant woman being told the sex of the fetus at ultrasonography at a time when an unquestioned abortion is possible is the starting point of female feticide from a health-care perspective," writes Kale.A study done in Canada found a distorted ratio of male to female births in the Indo-Canadian community, particularly among couples that already have two daughters."So clearly female feticide is happening, especially at the time of the third child," Kale said.In the editorial, Kale proposes postponing the disclosure of the gender, which he called "medically irrelevant information" in most cases, until after about 30 weeks of pregnancy.Obstetricians group disagreesKale wants to see gender disclosure policies at 30 weeks adopted by the provincial colleges that govern doctors. "Such clear direction from regulatory bodies would be the most important step toward curbing female feticide in Canada."People may try to get around the regulation but that's no reason not to try, says Dr. Rajendra Kale.(CBC)The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada said Kale' s proposal is inconsistent with their policy, which states that "a patient's request for disclosure should be respected, either directly or in a report to the referring health professional."In an email to CBC News, the obstetricians group said it believes it is the right of the patient to be informed of the gender of the fetus.The editorial also did not consider tests on the market that give expectant parents a fetal sex determination of high accuracy as early as eight weeks into a pregnancy, the group notes.People will always try to get around regulations but that's no reason not to have them, Kale counters.The obstetricians group says it doesn't condone abortions based on non-medical reasons such as the gender of the fetus."The SOGC feels strongly that it is the cultural values and norms in specific segments of the Canadian population that must change to ensure that females are not confronted with procedures and intolerant environments before or after they are born," the association said.Education callDr. Pargat Singh Bhurji, a pediatrician in Surrey, B.C., calls the practice of female feticide barbaric."People [do] not want to come forward to talk about this," Bhurji said. "But what I'm saying is this is definitely happening."Couples can go to clinics in the U.S. that advertise early sex determination in Indian newspapers, Bhurji notes. Cultural factors such as dowry and the belief a boy is needed to carry the family name drive some, he adds.The long-term goal has to be education, Bhurji says.Dr. Samuel Soliman of the New Life Fertility Centre in Mississauga said some patients have told him they've had abortions after having a girl or two."I think it is part of the whole spectrum of violence against women, which starts from inside the uterus to the outside and the value of women," says Soliman.While the rule against disclosing gender might work in Canada, Soliman said, it would not apply in the U.S., Soliman notes.With files from CBC's Kelly Crowe and Pauline DakinShare ToolsReport TypoSend FeedbackStay Connected with CBC NewsMobileFacebookPodcastsTwitterAlertsNewsletterBig Box AdvertisementTop News HeadlinesNavy officer accused of spying forgoes bail bidA Canadian navy intelligence officer charged with communicating information to a foreign entity or terrorist group has agreed to stay in custody for now and not make a bail application, his lawyer says. more »Italian cruise ship wreck yields 5 more bodiesRescue workers discover five more bodies in an Italian cruise ship wreck, raising the death toll to 11, as a recording shows its captain made excuses when asked to reboard. more »Central bank stands pat with 1% rateThe Bank of Canada held its target for the overnight interest rate steady at 1.0 per cent, the 11th consecutive time it has chosen to do so. more »Harper says pipeline debate should be left to CanadiansPrime Minister Stephen Harper believes decisions on expanding pipelines should be made by Canadians, he told CBC chief correspondent Peter Mansbridge during an interview. more »Iris implants threaten visionUsing surgical implants to change eye colour can rob people of their vision, some Canadian eye specialists warn. more »More Headlines »Most RecentWatchListenShow previous slideShow next slideShow previous slideShow next slideLatest Health News HeadlinesIris implants threaten visionUsing surgical implants to change eye colour can rob people of their vision, some Canadian eye specialists warn. more »Babies read lips while learning to talkBabies don't learn to talk just from hearing sounds but also from lip reading, new research suggests. more »PM urges premiers to put health funding issue asidePrime Minister Stephen Harper says he hopes provincial and territorial leaders can "put the funding issue aside" as they discuss the future of health care in Canada. more »Paramedics in fire halls may speed up serviceParamedics in Thunder Bay will soon park their ambulances at some fire halls.
