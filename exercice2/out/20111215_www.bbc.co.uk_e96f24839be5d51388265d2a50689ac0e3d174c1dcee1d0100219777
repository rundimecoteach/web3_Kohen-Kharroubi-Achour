Twenty-six per cent were obese, up from 13% in 1993, when the survey was first carried out. Fifty-eight per cent of women were overweight, with 26% of those obese - up from 16% in 1993.More on This StoryRelated Internet linksNHS Information CentreFPAThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sitesShare this pageDeliciousDiggFacebookredditStumbleUponTwitterEmailPrintMore Health storiesRSSTest 'improves cancer screening'Smear tests designed to cut deaths from cervical cancer could be improved by adding a further test looking for signs of a virus which causes it.Hairy limbs keep bed bugs at bayMany diabetes deaths 'avoidable'Top StoriesUS flag ceremony ends war in IraqFrench call to downgrade UK firstMilitary to provide 2012 securitySS hit man begins jail term at 90Chirac found guilty of corruptionFeatures & AnalysisCharles's giftsSix things Dickens gave the modern worldIn picturesThe art of rolling the perfect Cuban cigarEuro fault-lineRobert Peston on the big banks keeping regulators awake at nightLand revoltInside the Chinese village gripped by civil disobedienceMost PopularShared1: Banksy unveils church abuse work2: US flag ceremony ends war in Iraq3: Six things Dickens gave the modern world4: Baby seal wanders into NZ home5: How overseas jobs hit family lifeRead1: French call to downgrade UK first2: SS hit man begins jail term at 903: Six things Dickens gave the modern world4: US flag ceremony ends war in Iraq5: Buble fans walk out over language6: How overseas jobs hit family life7: Banksy unveils church abuse work8: 2012 security troops announced9: Mandela spy cameras confiscated10: Chirac found guilty of corruptionVideo/Audio1: One-minute World News Watch2: Worst NZ floods for ten years Watch3: Inside China's 'protest village' Watch4: I was drinking '10 bottles of wine a day' Watch5: Toxic alcohol kills 143 in India Watch6: Baby seal wanders into NZ home Watch7: US flag ceremony ends war in Iraq Watch8: Jackson daughter on that 'stupid' mask Watch9: How do you solve hotel insomnia?
