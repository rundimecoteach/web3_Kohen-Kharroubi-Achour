The meals had anywhere from less than half a cup to more than a cup and a half of macaroni and cheese, the main dish.That was presented along with plenty of green beans and unsweetened applesauce, plus a whole grain roll and milk.Jennifer Savage of The Pennsylvania State University in University Park and her colleagues found that the bigger the entrée size, the more mac and cheese -- and the less of the healthy side dishes -- kids ate.Preschoolers finished almost all of their smallest portion of mac and cheese, for an average of about 145 calories. But they still ate the majority of much bigger portions, and put away 390 calories worth of the main course when they started with the most on their plate.When they were served the smallest entrée, kids ate almost half of their healthy side dishes, including fruits and veggies, compared to only a quarter when they were served the biggest mac and cheese portion, Savage's team reports in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.Kids' total lunchtime calorie counts varied based on entrée size as well: they ate an average of 506 calories with the biggest portion, and 315 with the smallest.Ad FeedbackSweitzer said that packing too much of the main course for lunch is a problem she sees all the time with parents, in part because they're concerned they won't include enough food and their kids will be hungry."You will see parents pack the whole easy mac and cheese portion," she said. "That would be a huge amount -- it would be adequate for an adult to eat as part of lunch, and they'll pack that whole thing for the child to eat."And a four-year-old, she said, won't make balanced food choices on their own in that situation."If you give the child an option for a large portion of an entrée food that they really like, they will eat that more and they'll fill up. They'll reach their satiety point and they'll just stop eating," Sweitzer told Reuters Health.She added that another strategy to encourage kids to eat their fruits and veggies is for parents and older siblings to set a good example by choosing those as healthy snacks and making sure they're loading up on their nutrient-packed side dishes at meals.- ReutersNext Life & Style story:How mens' shoes are madeLife & Style HomepageSponsored linksShare this pageEmailFacebookMySpaceDiggStumbleUponDeliciousRedditLinkedinTwitterLife & Style HeadlinesRSSAre we all fat-ist?Lunch boxes examined in new studyHow mens' shoes are madeApp adds incentive to workoutGowns glow at Golden Globes10 things I learnt about men this summerPhotographs showcase 60s styleDriver's 170kmh Hilux trip on iPod: courtCar maker builds a better iPhone casePartying with your kidsScam threat checklistWIN: Unveiled Exhibition: 200 Years of Wedding FashionHoney, I shrunk the ElantraNew Dodge Journey has the goodsAd FeedbackStuff HeadlinesRSSFirefighters battle blaze in HastingsWoman attacked at Auckland schoolOutrage at Wainui brothel commentBig Day Out 2012 to be last in New ZealandCar keys led to drain death: policeRobson creates gay rights stir at Australian OpenNZ fur seal deaths in Australia still unexplainedWainuiomata outraged over brothel commentsZion buyer lined up: receiversDriver's 170kmh Hilux trip on iPod: courtLocal Maori to bury jawbone found on beachAuckland board members weigh in on port disputeCar maker builds a better iPhone caseTrans-Tasman cable agreement madeWikipedia to shut for 24 hours in protestSpecial offersMost popularViewedSharedCommentedFirefighters battle blaze in HastingsWoman left naked in street after attackBig Day Out 2012 to be last in New ZealandWoman attacked at Auckland schoolCar keys led to drain death: policeChristchurch shaken by 4.1 earthquake aftershockRobson creates gay rights stir at Australian OpenOutrage at Wainui brothel commentShane Warne in road rage incident with cyclistCruise stunt flagged on FacebookAuckland board members weigh in on port disputeAuckland board members weigh in on port disputeFirefighters battle blaze in HastingsAuckland local boards weigh in on port disputeBig Day Out 2012 to be last in New ZealandChristchurch shaken by 4.1 earthquake aftershockLife on the edge of a raw nerveWoman left naked in street after attackWoman attacked at Auckland schoolGreipel wins opening Tour Down Under stageOpinion pollAre you going on a New Year detox?Yes and so far, so goodI tried to!No, waste of timeI don't need toVoteResultRelated story: Booze-free month 'waste of time' - expertFeatured PromotionsSponsored ContentBlogs»The Omnivore: Jeremy Taylor on foodHow bistro food should bePG (Parental Guidance Advised): A blog for parentsPartying with your kidsMoata's Blog IdleScam threat checklistFour Legs Good: the blog about pets and animalsPurely kittens (pictures)Are We There Yet?
