The project is finally being realized as part of a multi-million dollar redevelopment project that will see a new two-storey health complex rise in the Maryland South building's place. The new complex, to be built over the next 18 to 24 months, will house the Buhler Eye Care Centre, an ambulatory diagnostic centre, and a health centre for seniors touted as a "one-stop shop" for everything from rehabilitation to social activities.Phase 2 of the redevelopment plan will see the Sherbrook Building on the other side of the hospital demolished and replaced with a new chapel and front entrance, as well as space for medical programs.Ice roads swallow vehiclesPreviousNextBuy Sun Media photosA wrecking ball was used to help demolish the Maryland South building at Misericordia Health Centre in Winnipeg on Jan. 11, 2012.

The project's supervisor said that's not an unusual occurrence since the ball is being dragged in and out of jagged holes.
