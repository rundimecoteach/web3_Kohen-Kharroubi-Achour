The PIP furore has led to widespread debate within the public and the industry itself over how far people’s confidence in the safety and regulation of cosmetic surgery will have been tarnished by this controversy.The PatientsEileen NewittIt was during the 1960s when Blisworth resident Eileen Newitt underwent surgery to have lumps removed from her breasts.Although it was found that these lumps were not cancerous, the operation left Mrs Newitt requiring cosmetic implants to restore the appearance of her breasts.These implants were not PIP but the scandal which has been gracing newspaper headlines in recent weeks certainly sparked unpleasant memories as, since her operation in 1985, her implants have ruptured twice.The first rupture, in 1993, resulted in a court case for compensation in which she was awarded $50,000 in compensation from an American company, losing all but $850 to legal fees.She also underwent another operation to have this implant replaced.She said: “I did not appeal as I did not have the finances or the legal know-how to do it. When the call came to say they had been granted the permission (to take legal fees from the compensation) there was nothing left.”Her doctors have advised her that no urgent action needs to be taken about her most recent rupture, which was discovered 11 years after the first, in 2004.But the recent story about PIP has left her worried.She said: “The consultant at the hospital said I need not do anything as it would not harm me. I have spoken to my GP and he also assured me there was nothing to worry about as the substance they are made of is inert. I accepted this as I suffer no effects from it but since the report about PIP implants I can’t help but think about it.”The 64-year-old said she would like to see more research and regulation into the manufacture of breast implants.She said: “If they were more solid there would be nothing to leak.“It is no different to having a new hip or knee, which are put into people’s bodies all the time, but with these sorts of things if they can rupture they really need to be looked at.”AlisonFor months now, breast implant patient Alison has been suffering from pins and needles and numbness in one arm.This week, according to Alison, her GP confirmed suspicions that one of the PIP implants placed inside her during 2008 by a clinic in London had ruptured.Alison, aged 46, who lives in South Northamptonshire and did not want to reveal her surname, said she had telephoned the clinic but, at the time when she spoke to the Chron yesterday, had been unable to get through. She believes she now faces an operation to have the implants taken out through the NHS, but is unsure how or when she will be able to have them replaced.Regarding a replacement operation, Alison said: “I think they are not going to do it but I want to hear what the clinic has to say. I would like them to do the whole thing free of charge because I paid £4,500 and everyone should have a guarantee.“I think the Government could have done better in making the clinics do something, they say they have a moral duty so it’s like saying ‘if you want to do something you can.’ In my situation I can’t afford to wait months and months, I have to do what the doctors say, get them taken out and be disfigured.”She said: “So many people think you have implants to be like a glamour girl. For myself, I had been bullied all my life for being flat chested and I felt I had to have this operation. It makes me really angry that even women think you are a tart or a glamour girl because you have had them done.”LouiseAmong the PIP implant patients waiting to find out what the next step will be is 25-year-old Northampton mum Louise.Louise, who did not want her surname revealed, had implants put in through the same clinic in London, to help repair the effects to her body which had happened following the birth of her child.She said; “Before I had the surgery I did think about the complications that can happen but when you have paid for something in a situation like this, where do you turn, who do you speak to?“If I have to have them taken out, will I have to pay to have them replaced? I had them done for a reason.”She continued: “If they are going to be taken out, I think someone somewhere along the line is going to need to replace them.”THE surgeonsAdrian RichardsDespite the fact the Aurora Clinics, based in Northampton, have never used PIP implants, the clinics’ phones have been busy taking calls from worried women.Surgical director Adrian Richards has been offering free advice to callers who are unsure of the next step to take. He believes that if all clinics kept to a compulsory registration system, recording and monitoring the types of implants patients have, it would be easier to identify the suppliers with higher rupture rates.The idea is that, if a problem emerges with one particular implant, women anywhere in the country who have received it could be contacted straight away through a central registration system.He said: “I have never done these (PIP implants) but the impact is that we have become fairly busy. There are 30-40,000 women in the UK who have had implants and a lot of women don’t know if they have them. I have been arguing for years that I would like a registration system.”He continued: “A lot of women don’t know what type of implants they have had, some women know they have got PIP implants and some women think they may have them but there is no way of scanning to see what implants they have, you have to see by physically looking at the implants.”He added: “It should be more like America where they only allow two or three types of implants, it is very strict. Surgeons will tend to use the best products but the bigger companies are all about profit.”Nitin Vaingankar (pictured)As a consultant plastic surgeon who carries out work privately, and for NHS patients at Northampton General Hospital, Nitin Vaingankar has never used PIP implants.His work at NGH involves putting breast implants into certain patients who have had medical conditions such as cancer, although a very small number of purely cosmetic procedures can also be carried out on the NHS, for example in cases where breasts are seriously underdeveloped.He said the hospital has been busily taking calls from anxious women who are unsure about whether or not they have had PIP implants.He commented: “The reporting of the story about PIP has caused a lot of anxiety in patients who have had breast implants, but if they know they have not had PIP implants they don’t need to be worried at all.”He added: “There has been some concern that PIP implants haven’t been made using medical grade silicone and that is the problem. But patients who have had the implants shouldn’t panic, they should contact their surgeon or clinic to confirm what make implants they have had and for further advice and management.”Mr Vaingankar said: “It would be untrue to say implants don’t rupture at all, silicone can rupture but it is usually a long term process and doesn’t normally cause any health problems to the patient. Our five year data for the implants we use show a zero per cent rupture rate, I have done no repairs on patients with these implants in. The implants manufactured in his country are manufactured to a high standard.”Statement from London based medical clinic“The advice from the Department of Health continues to be that there is not sufficient evidence to recommend routine implant removal and women who are concerned should speak to their GP. The Department of Health’s expert review has not established if the rupture rate is higher for PIP implants than for other implants. It has also confirmed that there is no evidence of any cancer risk from the materials used.“PIP implants were licensed in the UK by the MHRA, an agency of the Department of Health, for use in the UK. As a result, the NHS, private clinics, private hospitals and private surgeons used these implants in cosmetic and reconstructive surgery.“Today, some media have quoted inaccurate numbers of operations carried out by our group involving PIP implants. We have been auditing our rupture records for many years now and have not found, to date, cause for concern.”Email to a friendPrint this pageCommentsThere are 1 comments to this articleOrder by:Newest first|Oldest firstPage 1 of 11Show all1haveavoiceTuesday, January 10, 2012 at 12:05 PMI am Alison, as named in the above article. I would like to update my news story, after consulting my GP and having a rupture confirmed, she offered me a removal only on the NHS. Later the GP called to say that the medical board would not approve the removal on the NHS, and that she would send me for an Ultra Sound appointment though. On ringing for an appointment i was confronted by a very rude lady at the Breast Clinic at Northampton Hospital, who made it clear you cant have the scan. I have an appointment today with my GP to start the process all over again today, and complain about the verbal attack from the lady at the breast clinic. What i would like to say is i agree the NHS should not be funding the mess up from these private clinics, but the private clinics should be forced to put right all this. The Goverment stated " The private clinics have a moral duty to help us" but the Goverment who are the big bosses should be saying " You will be made to clean up this mess". I brought GOODS in good faith, just like any other GOODS you might buy, and we have been dumped on by everyone. People all have there opinions on plastic surgery, but none of us should put up with abuse for something we paid for in good faith. I am suffering physically and mentally, also going through utter hell so please the public have some compassion and understanding.Report UnsuitableOrder by:Newest first|Oldest firstPage 1 of 11Show allLogged in as:Comment here.Please adhere to our Community guidelinesYour viewPlease sign in to be able to comment on this story.Top storiesThe Chron looks at the latest legislation regarding caged birdsHelp is at hand for single parents to make the most of life for them and their childrenExamining the reasons behind a rise in deaths from liver diseaseThe Chron looks at the debate surrounding the 2004 Hunting ActA Northamptonshire woman’s experience of seeing orang-utans in BorneoNewsLocalNewsdesk LiveCrimeEducationPoliticsHealthEnvironment & TransportBusinessFeaturesNationalRegionalNews ColumnistsBehind The HeadlinesShowbizDigital EditionsReader lettersPopularMost commentsMost sharedBREAKING NEWS: Two teenagers killed in car crash in NorthamptonshireSadness as world-renowned Northampton store set to close downBREAKING NEWS: Streets sealed off as man threatened to jump from top of Grosvenor CentreInvestigation into ghostly goings-on at ‘paranormal’ Northampton pubBREAKING NEWS: Police name man killed in crash in NorthamptonshireSadness as world-renowned Northampton store set to close downControversial high speed rail project HS2 approvedCouncil’s refusal to give wet room funding leaves eight-year-old facing 16-mile trip for showerThird of applications for blue badge permits in Northamptonshire already refused under new legislationInvestigation into ghostly goings-on at ‘paranormal’ Northampton pubPub silenced by ruling over Christmas songsEXCLUSIVE: Art collector vows to prove ‘Cezanne’ signature is genuine and says: ‘Why put a Mercedes badge on a pushbike?’Sadness as world-renowned Northampton store set to close downYours for £50, busts of William and KateFans turn out in force to see Katie Price at town centre book signingSearch for:
