'While they might happily overlook a few common flaws, there are certain behaviours that men just won't get away with.'The poll found that women look for a good personality, a sense of humour and good looks, while dodgy dancing, leaving clothes lying around on the bedroom floor and snoring are sure signs of imperfection.One in five women would forgive leaving the toilet seat up and a lack of culinary skills but men using their girlfriend's toothbrush and not listening were sure fire ways to lose 'perfect' points.'The average guy may not be able to compete with the image of David Beckham, but there are still a number of small changes they can do to make a big difference,' says Miss McReynolds.CLICK HERE FOR MORE WORLD NEWSThursday 15 December 2011Rate this ...Rate this contentAverageBetterOkGoodExcellentThanks, your rating has been counted!Current rating:Be the first to voteShare this article ...Email this to a friendIPC Media Limited, owner of marieclaire.co.uk, will collect the address of the recipient solely to process your request.ToBookmarkClick on a link below to share this article with your favourite link sharing siteDiggRedditFacebookNow PublicNewsvineDel.icio.usLast ArticleGenerosity is key to a happy marriage Read more...Breaking headlines ...Golden Globe 2012 nominations announced!FIRST LOOK: Robert Pattinson's sizzling new Bel Ami stillsLady Gaga named most powerful celebrity in the worldPrince William & Kate Middleton's second overseas visit confirmedAngry Demi Moore hits out at fans on TwitterPlus, read our Latest blogs, enter hot competitions, and much, much more...Hot CompetitionsAdvent CalendarMartha Hayes BlogCatwalk ShowsBeauty GeniusShoppingNewsCelebrity NewsFashion NewsHealth NewsBeauty NewsWorld NewsInspire & MentorFashionFashion WeekShopBuy of the Day10 BestFashion PicturesFashion VideosHair & beautyHairShopBuy of the Day10 BestHair & Beauty PicturesBeauty VideosHair VideosAsk the ExpertsCelebrityCelebrity A-ZCelebrity PicturesCelebrity Interviews10 BestCelebrity VideosCompetitions & OffersQuizzesBlogsCompetitionsOffersAbout usHoroscopesLifestyleIssues and Campaigns10 BestEthical LivingRecipesRestaurant ReviewsLifestyle PicturesInspire & MentorLifestyle VideosHealthDiet PlansAsk the ExpertsSpa and Salon DirectoryDiet Club10 BestHealth & Fitness videosTravelTravel News10 BestCity GuidesCountry GuidesHotel ReviewsTravel PicturesSubscribe to:Marie Claire MagazineEmail NewsletterRSS feeds:Get the latest headlines to your desktopJoin us on:Â© Marie Claire 2011Contact usTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyMarie Claire subscriptionsSitemapWorldwide Marie Claire:AustraliaBrazilChinaFranceHong KongItalyJapanMalaysiaSpainTaiwanTurkeyUSAOther IPC Titles:InStylehousetohomeHomes and GardensIdeal HomeLivingetcWoman & HomeWallpaperNowHorse and HoundFeelgood Games:Feelgood GamesPuzzlesCard GamesJigsawsWord GamesBejewelled 2MahjongSolitaire
