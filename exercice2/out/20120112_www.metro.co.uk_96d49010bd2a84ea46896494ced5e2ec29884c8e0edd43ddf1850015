They include Essex lap dancer Rebecca Bowler, 25, who faces three months off work if she has her £4,200 implants removed.Eight private companies and the NHS are offering free replacements. Health secretary Andrew Landsley told the Commons it was not ‘fair to the taxpayer for the NHS to foot the bill for patients who had their operation privately’.British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons president Fazel Fatah said it was ‘outrageous’ some clinics were refusing their duty of care after profiting from cheap products.TweetWhat would you like to say?To add a YouTube video, insert its web address hereSendto Metro and share on:NewestOldestMost PopularLeast Popular2:08 PM on 1/12/2012sadwhy not use some of their profits to replace these deffective implants.they are only interested in profit.they should be sued by all their customers if they dont agree to put right the problem.2:08 PM on 1/12/2012sadwhy not use some of their profits to replace these deffective implants.they are only interested in profit.they should be sued by all their customers if they dont agree to put right the problem.12:20 PM on 1/12/2012The fifth horsemanOh really - I wonder how much the Harley Medical Group charged for each operation they undertook and how much profit they made! Perhaps the government should bankrupt these greedy parasites, who obviously purchased these particular implants because they were the cheapest available and thus maximized their profits! A thought - is it not correct to assume that products from an EU supplier have been thoroughly checked by the 'home' government? If so, the NHS and all private medical groups both here and throughout the EU should insist, through the European Parliament, that France picks up the bill!Related itemsTOWIE's Lauren Pope: I'm a victim of banned PIP breast implantsNatasha Hamilton: Banned PIP breast implants gave me rock-hard boobsPrivate clinics told they should remove PIP breast implantsPIP breast implant fears surfaced seven years ago as women await reportRock the week filesModern Warfare 3: Rock the week MoreRugby World Cup: Rock the Week MoreCelebrity Big Brother 2011: Rock The Week MoreClapham's broom army: Rock the Week MoreCesc Fabregas transfer saga: Rock the Week MoreReading and Leeds Festival 2011: Rock The Week More5 day forecast | Local WeatherFor your iPad: Metro tablet edition launchedMetro has launched its first interactive version of the newspaper designed especially for the iPad - and it's free...Our choiceMost readWayne Rooney outclassed on FIFA 12 by world championThis Morning's Holly Willoughby left red-faced after naughty cheese mix-upLee Steele sacked by Oxford City over Gareth Thomas homophobic tweetEmma Watson snuggles up to mystery man as he plants a kiss on her cheekGraduate told to work for free or lose benefitsIn their words: Scottish debateRoald Dahl celebrated with stampsRandy the ram sires 33 lambs in 24hrsNudist shock in kids' clothing advertVinnie Jones on how to perform CPRMetro
