Study finds babies fed on formula milk cry less and are easier to get to sleepResearchers say irritability linked to breastfeeding is natural, and not a sign of stress or even hungerBy
Fiona MacraeLast updated at 11:23 PM on 10th January 2012Comments (328)ShareResearchers say irritability linked to breastfeeding is natural, and not a sign of stress or even hungerIt is often said that breast is best. But bottle-fed babies are the best behaved.A study of British infants found those who were breast-fed cried more, smiled and laughed less and were harder to soothe and get off to sleep than their formula-fed counterparts.The Cambridge researchers however, say that the irritability linked to breastfeeding is only natural, and not a sign of stress or even necessarily hunger.Instead, it is the baby’s way of bonding and seeking attention and security.While bottle fed babies may seem more content, they may simply have eaten too much.Like adults who comfort eat, they may have been calmed by eating, or drinking, more than they should.A crying baby may simply be seeking the comfort and closeness of its mother, researchers sayIn one of the first studies of its kind, the temperament of more than 300 babies was assessed when they were three months old.More...Traditional Chinese medicine 'makes fertility treatments more effective''Miracle' mother with terminal cancer blames NHS delay in approving treatment for incurable diseaseThis
was done by asking their mothers to answer almost 200 questions about
their children from how they responded to being washed and dressed to
how easy they were to get down to sleep.The results varied little between boys and girls, socio-economic status of the parents or the mother’s age.However, there was a clear link with the method of feeding, the journal PLoS ONE reports.Researcher Ken Ong, of the Medical
Research Council Epidemiology Unit in Cambridge, said that the cries of a
breast-fed baby don’t necessarily mean it is hungry.Instead, the child may simply be seeking the comfort and closeness of its mother.Dr Ong, a paediatrician, said: ‘If anything, what might account for the difference is that bottle-fed babies possibly get more nutrients than is typical.‘Research suggests that these infants may be over-nourished and gain weight too quickly.‘Our findings are essentially similar to other stages of life; people often find that eating is comforting.‘Rather than being put off breast-feeding, parents should have more realistic expectations of normal infant behaviour and should receive better understanding and support to cope with difficult infant behaviours if needed.‘These approaches could potentially promote successful breastfeeding, because currently many mothers attempt to breastfeed but give up after the first few weeks.’The latest research sheds new light on the theory that 'breast is best'Breastfeeding has been shown to help protect babies against obesity, eczema and ear, chest and tummy bugs.Avoiding formula can cut the odds of child being a fussy eater in later life, as well as cut the woman’s odds of some cancers and help with weight loss.Despite this, Britain has one of the lowest breast-feeding rates in Europe.Around three-quarters of new mothers start breastfeeding but by four months, this number has dropped to just a one-third.Professor Nick Wareham, director of the MRC Epidemiology Unit, said that while the results don’t prove breastfeeding to be the cause of the babies’ irritability, learning more about the subject could help boost breastfeeding rates.But other said that in some cases only a bottle will satisfy a baby’s hunger.Clare Byam-Cook, a former midwife who has taught celebrities such as Kate Winslet and Natasha Kaplinsky how to feed their babies, said: ‘Breast is definitely best – as long as mother and baby are thriving on it.‘But if your baby is crying and unsettled and when you give it a bottle it becomes calm and settled, then a bottle is best.‘If you offer the baby a bottle and he doesn’t settle, then something else is the problem and the mother needs to find out what it is.’Share this article:FacebookTwitterGoogle+MessengerLinkedInDigg itNewsvineFarkNowpublicRedditPrint articleEmail articleAdd your commentsComments (328)Here's what other readers have said.

1Report abuseI don't care how many 'experts' say bottle feeding is best, it isn't. Breast is best there is no argument, it is tailor made for a baby and to say otherwise is just plain stupid. If you breast feed your baby they will not be fussy eaters as they have had a 'taste' of all the food you eat via breast milk. Bottle feeding is being pushed becuse it fits in with working women and breast feeding doesn't, it's just another ruse to keep women as wage slaves when they should be at home feeding and looking after their children themselves. Also bottle formula is made from soy which is toxic to babies "most serious problem with soy formula is the presence of phytoestrogens or isoflavones. While many claims have been made about the health benefits of these estrogen-like compounds, animal studies indicate that they are powerful endocrine disrupters that alter growth patterns and cause sterility."- lets get back to basics and out of the EUSSR, Nottingham, 12/1/2012 02:58Click to rateRating
3Report abuseWe need research on the impact of mothers' diet on the quality and nutrient levels of breast milk. Such a study could help doctors and dieticians advise mothers on dietary matters to enhance the benefits of breast milk. It could also challenge the findings of this study which maybe erroneously explains away babies' irritability as an attempt to bond. It could be that a nutritionally inadequate diet produces poor quality breastmilk and the poor grizzling babies are in fact malnourished.- EiLing, Sydney, Australia, 12/1/2012 01:38Click to rateRating
2Report abuseStu, Laholm, Sweden, 11/1/2012 13:35....I was joking when I asked if your successful (and, I hope, happy and healthy) daughter was breastfed. Also, maybe I was not clear, but my paediatrician's advice was the SAME as your daughter's which is that the gap between formula and breastmilk has closed in nutritional terms. Obviously formula cannot offer the same double immunity that a baby gets from breastmilk and yes, there are health benefits to the mother from breastfeeding, but these have to be balanced with the negative effects of stress, lack of sleep and a hungry unhappy (potentially malnourished) baby when breastfeeding does not work out. As long as people are making informed choices it really is not anyone else's business how they respond to their particular circumstances and choose to feed their baby.- Emma, London, 11/1/2012 23:54Click to rateRating

1Report abuseHacienda Girl - I hope your ignorance isnt passed on to your child! Not everyone can breast feed - that's why wet nurses used to exist and why formula was invented in the first place!- Tiny, Birmingham Uk, 11/1/2012 23:01Click to rateRating
2Report abuse"So it's very easy to say I wasn't producing enough milk!!! Or it's embarrassing to feed in public!? Excuses that too many women make. Be honest and say you DON'T want to feed but don't lie and make up things!!!! "- Doherty967, Doherty, 11/1/2012 19:53
My milk never came in(OH MY LORD, I JUST MADE AN EXCUSE!!!!!)...really, not any of it (which was heartbreaking as I did want to breastfeed and I did try)...so of course I should've just let my child starve rather than feed her formula! I say do what you are comfortable with and know that not breastfeeding doesn't make you a bad mom, just like breastfeeding doesn't automatically make you a good mom.- Courtney, the Tejas, USA, 11/1/2012 22:30Click to rateRating
13Report abuseHear, hear Some common sense at last. I bottle fed both my children who at the ages of 10 and 7 have barely had a days illness between them and were both fantastic sleepers.

7Report abuse"And for those of you who complain that Midwifes 'force' you to breastfeed, remember they are health professionals and it their job to 'Promote Health' BREAST IS BEST!"- Doherty967,...Midwives and health visitors only know about infant nutrition what they are told by the scientific community - they are nurses who deliver babies, not nutritionists or researchers. If parents don't want to breastfeed, they should be able to say so without fear of being lectured or castigated by a nurse.- Stu, Laholm, Sweden, 11/1/2012 22:11Click to rateRating
5Report abuseI didn't breast feed either of my two children, I didn't feel comfortable doing it and it was my choice not to. I'm fed up of being told I'm a bad Mother.
