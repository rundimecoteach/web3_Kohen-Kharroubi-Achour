In addition, they are of the opinion that the government must make it mandatory for beverage manufacturers to display a health label of warning just like those available on over-the-counter tablets that contain caffeine as an active compound.While expressing concerns regarding the issue, one of the lead researchers of the study, a clinical senior lecturer at the University of Sydney and the medical director and toxicologist at the NSW Poisons Information Centre, Naren Gunja, said: “Consumers are likely to be unaware of the variation in chemical composition and caffeine dosage in energy drinks, and with little or no warnings on products, the potential for overdose remains ever-present”.As per reports, a massive surge in call volumes related to caffeinated energy drinks has been seen over a period of time. While there were just 12 such calls made in 2004, the year 2010 witnessed more than 65 such calls.»Add new commentLatest NewsUS Business NewsOnLive Launches 25 New Games for SubscribersRIM Loses Trademark Lawsuit to BasisMicrosoft’s Novel Windows Store To Come Up In February 2012Panel Reveals New Facts about Japan's Olympus Corp’s ScandalU.S. Postal Service to Slow DownmoreCanada NewsFrankenstein Ants Created by ScientistsCrackpipes Supply Less Than DemandAgent Orange Cases to Be Given Compensation SoonIt’s Time Again for New Year ResolutionsMethamphetamine Drug Users More Likely to Have Suicidal TendencymoreInternet and Web2.0Facebook Turning out to be the Next Big Thing to Get Organ DonorsRed Cross Keeps Blood Drives Flowing With FacebookAkamai to acquire network-software maker Cotendo for $268 millionNew Simpler Twitter version Is OutFacebook Requires Comprehensive Privacy ProgrammoreEconomyInflation under Control in USPanel Reveals New Facts about Japan's Olympus Corp’s ScandalSlowdown Makes EC to Lose Confidence in Euro-Region EconomyU.S. Postal Service to Slow DownGerman Unemployment Rate FallsmoreCompany ResultsApple Motorola lock hornsAT&T and T-Mobile’s Merger under ScannerNvidia’s Whooping High ProfitsmorePollDo you Feel better under President Obama's rule:Yes, he has performed really wellNo, I feel he hasn't worked as expectedThere isn't much of differenceNew YorkComputer Exergames Contribute to Cognitive Improvement in AgedIs New York The City of Longevity?Strikes Averted by Fruitful, Careful NegotiationsHigh on CaffeineNYC Registers 1.2% Decline In Childhood ObesitymoreNew Zealand NewsTB Outbreaks Call For Quarantining PatientsHealth Test Fraudsters Put Behind BarsEdible Chip Medicine in Britain by SeptemberMWS Is Irrelevant, Claims ReviewInadequate Funds Causing Menace In Australian HospitalsmoreLatest Forum PostsIntroductionZaheer Khan, Isha Sharvani To Get MarriedZaheer Khan, Isha Sharvani To Get MarriedZaheer Khan, Isha Sharvani To Get MarriedBank Nifty Levels for TomorrowmoreSearchSearch this site:User loginLog in using OpenID:What is OpenID?Username: *Password: *Log in using OpenIDCancel OpenID loginCreate new accountRequest new passwordNavigationRecent postsFeed aggregatorCompany NewsFoshan City Witnesses Cruelty towards an Injured KidAuthorities Call ETA to End Their Violent ActsAsian Stocks On RiseSamsung Asks For the Ban Of Apple’s iPhone 4SHong Kong Shares See RisemoreCompany News IndiaRIL may acquire stake in Hathway Cables, Den NetworksVolkswagen's China sales go up in 2011Infosys net up 33 percent in third quarterSamsung releases upgradeable TelevisionsMahindra reveals new HyAlfa three wheeler at 2012 Auto ExpomoreWho's newalekuperdfAssectismgaurbefaurnmaxigruzoneRaccugsspoofsSyndicateRecent blog postsBraiding Causes Baldness - New DataAnti-Smoking Lobby in the UK Face Heat from RetailersMental Health Budgets Suffer from Decreasing FundsMedtronic Resolves Issues with FDAMedicare and Medicaid Fraud Reaches an Estimated $47 BillionFirst Drug for Lupus in 50 Years Released Passed Approval WednesdayAmazon: HTC Desire S will likely be released on April 18;
