If no new cases emerge and the virus doesn’t show up in environmental tests for one more month, the country could be taken off the list of the four remaining nations where polio is endemic, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative said.The body was formed by national governments, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children’s Fund, Rotary International and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1988. The other three countries where polio cases have continued without a break are Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria.India reported one case of polio on Jan. 13 last year from the state of West Bengal, compared with 42 cases in 2010. Two more years without fresh cases are needed for the country to be declared polio free, according to the Geneva-based agency.Poor SanitationThe polio virus is shed by infected people in feces and can spread as a result of poor sanitation and hygiene. Millions of people were paralyzed by the disease in the 20th century before vaccines became widely available in the 1950s.The international effort to end polio has cost more than $8 billion to date, according to Rotary International. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative faces a shortfall of $410 million in 2012, according to its website.“By continuing to raise the funds needed to run the campaign, world leaders can ultimately save billions of dollars and help to ensure that no child ever suffers from this crippling disease again,” Gates said.--Editors: Abhay Singh, John ChackoTo contact the reporter on this story: Adi Narayan in Mumbai at anarayan8@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jason Gale at j.gale@bloomberg.netBusiness ExchangeE-mailPrintREADER DISCUSSIONSponsored LinksBuy a link now!Most Popular ContentReadE-mailedDiscussedSlide ShowsThree Types of People to Fire ImmediatelyTop B-School Stories of 2011Lego Is for GirlsTransocean: No Apologies Over Gulf Oil SpillIt's Always Sunny in Silicon ValleyRSS Feed: Most Read StoriesThree Types of People to Fire ImmediatelyWhich Is America's Best City?Lego Is for GirlsTop B-School Stories of 2011Professional Women and a Secure RetirementRSS Feed: Most E-mailed StoriesKorea's Next Challenge: Global CompetitivenessRSS Feed: Most Discussed StoriesThe 20 Biggest Casinos2006 Best Global BrandsOlympic ArchitectureBest Young Tech Entrepreneurs 2009Fuqua Virtual TourRSS Feed: Most Popular Slide ShowsSlide Show2012 Range Rover EvoqueSpecial ReportCEO Guide to 3-D PrintingVideoPrivate Equity Firms Create Jobs, Rogers SaysSlide ShowTen Products Printed in 3DSpecial ReportFocus On Entrepreneurs, November 2011Video1/10: The Start of CES, Detroit Auto ShowPost a JobJobsBusiness Development jobsDesign jobsEntertainment jobsEnvironmental jobsExecutive jobsHealthcare jobsLegal jobsManagement jobsMarketing jobsReal Estate jobsRetail jobsSales jobsView all jobsSimplyHiredRelated topics inKnowledge Process OutsourcingIndia Offshore OutsourcingChange ManagementBusiness Process Outsourcing (BPO)China OutsourcingPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.Special ReportsFix This/TransportationCrisis in JapanHealth CareSentiment AnalysisMore Special ReportsBusiness ToolsB-School ComparisonB-School CalendarBW for MobileE-mail NewslettersRSSWhite PapersA-Z IndexBW AuthorsBX TopicsPrivate CompaniesPublic CompaniesLists & RankingsBest Global BrandsBest Places to Launch a CareerBest Providers of Customer ServiceBest Undergraduate Business SchoolsBusiness School Rankings & ProfilesBW 50: Best Performing CompaniesTop 100 IT CompaniesMost Innovative CompaniesFollow Us@BW on TwitterBW on FacebookBlogsEconoChatEuroCrisisJoshua Green on PoliticsOccupy Wall StreetSmall BusinessTechnology[+] Rate this pageSlideshow GalleryAutosBusiness SchoolsDesignInternationalInnovationInvestingManagingPolicyReal EstateSmall BusinessTechnologyMagazineCurrent IssueSubscribe NowBloombergAboutAdvertisingCustom PublishingEDGE ProgramsReprintsTerms of UseDisclaimerPrivacy NoticeEthics CodeContact UsSite Map©2012 Bloomberg L.P.
