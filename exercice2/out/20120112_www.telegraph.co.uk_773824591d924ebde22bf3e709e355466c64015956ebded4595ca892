showed signs of changes in the brain similar to alcoholics and cocaine
addicts.People who are addicted to the internet can find they suffer anxiety and guilt1:14PM GMT 12 Jan 2012CommentsProfessor Mark Griffiths says psychotherapy or drugs may be the solution: "It
is very important to make the distinction between people who are addicted to
the internet, and those who have addictions online."I believe it is a very different thing to be addicted to certain
applications online, such as gambling, gaming, shopping or online sex -
these are addictions on the internet, rather than to the internet, and
should be treated differently."As with any treatment, it is essential to understand the underlying
causes of the addiction."One person, for example, could suffer from low self-esteem which leads
them to create an online persona instead of interacting offline. In this
case, any treatment should focus on increasing their sense of self-worth."Another person who is very good at online gaming could get rewards from
their success; they will be praised by their peers for being the best at it.
In this case, they should find other activities which give them the same
rewards.Related ArticlesWeb addiction 'like drink problem'12 Jan 2012Smartphone addicts 'imagine texts'12 Jan 2012"There are a wide range of treatments available for addiction, from
taking drugs like Prozac to treat the symptoms and cravings, to cognitive
behavioural therapy, through to psychotherapy where they talk about
underlying problems."There is no evidence to show that one treatment is better than any
other, and most people will take a multimodal approach."Signs that you may be addicted:Losing track of time: Hours can fly by without your realising
because you are so absorbed in the activity. If a plan to spend a few
minutes on the internet regularly turns into hours you may have a problem.Irritability when interrupted: If you regularly get cranky if
you are interrupted online it could be a sign you are spending too much time
on the internet.Feelings of guilt: If you feel guilty about the amount of time
you spend online or if you often find your partner or family nagging you
about the time wasted it is possible you have an addiction.Isolation from family and friends: Is your social life suffering
because of the amount of time online? Losing touch with friends and family
is a sign that you are becoming addicted to the internet.A sense of euphoria when online and panic when offline: If you
feel euphoric or only calm when you are online while you feel anxious and
cut off when offline there is a chance you could be spending too much time
at the computerDry eyes, aches, weight gain or sleep disturbances: Any physical
changes as a result of spending too much time online are obvious signs that
something is wrong.Tips for breaking an internet addiction:Ask yourself, “What am I missing out on when I spend so much time
on the Internet?” Write down these activities and decrease your
Internet time to pursue some of them.Set reasonable Internet use goals and stick to them. Take
frequent breaks, at least 5 minutes each hour, and do some other activity.Alter your routine to break your usage patterns. If you spend
evenings on the Internet, start limiting your use to mornings.Seek out friends and acquaintances who “couldn’t care less” about the
Internet. Take time to appreciate the fact that all life is not yet
online.Stay connected to the offline world. Visit newsstands, book and
music stores, and participate in entertainment such as museums, music, and
live theatre. Novels and poetry readings are hard to experience online.Treat the Internet as a tool. Stay focused on the fact that the
Internet is a means to an end. Plan your strategy—whether you’re looking for
information or entertainment—with the end in mind and you’ll save valuable
time.Source: University of California, San FranciscoX Share & bookmarkDeliciousFacebookGoogleMessengerRedditTwitterDiggFarkLinkedInGoogle BuzzStumbleUponY!
