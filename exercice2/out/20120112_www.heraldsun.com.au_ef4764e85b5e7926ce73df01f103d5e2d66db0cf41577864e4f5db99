Picture: Chris Scott Source: Herald SunBEE Gee Robin Gibb has turned to a team of alternative medics as he battles liver cancer. The singer was diagnosed with the disease last year.He has received conventional treatment, including seven rounds of chemotherapy. Doctors were pleased with his progress but Gibb decided to seek other ways of recovery."Bee Gees star Robin Gibb has flown in a team of alternative medics from Switzerland as he battles liver cancer," British newspaper The Sun reported.It is claimed the group is on hand to help Gibb 24 hours a day. The "naturopath nutritionists" encourage him to eat foods that are good for the body so it is as strong as possible as he fights the disease.The star's wife Dwina reportedly asked her husband to speak to the professionals as she is a big believer in natural medication.It is believed Gibb, 62, has also been spending time in a special detox hut where he sweats and loses toxins."Robin is fighting this with dignity and courage. He's trying everything possible to beat this disease," an insider said.Gibb's diagnosis was first reported in November and came after the musician was seen looking increasingly frail in public.Soon after his diagnosis was reported, Gibb posted a message on his website reassuring fans he was doing well. "I have been very unwell and am now on the road to recovery, and your prayers and wishes are a great tonic to me," he wrote."I believe because of you I will get well and my deepest love goes out to you all."Increase Text SizeDecrease Text SizePrintEmailShareAdd to DiggAdd to del.icio.usAdd to FacebookAdd to KwoffAdd to MyspaceAdd to NewsvineWhat are these?Back to top of pageConfidentialHinch steps in to give away brideBLUSHING bride Elisabeth Kelly had something borrowed and something new on her arm yesterday - new mate Derryn Hinch.Offspring arrives ... right on cueKAT Stewart welcomed her very own Offspring into the world yesterday, giving birth to son Archie Nicholas in a Melbourne hospital.Red carpet: Top choice before big journeyNew hunk: Moore spotted in LA with young modelRelationships: Congrats to ex-lover from our KylieChat show: Ten in no rush to close The CircleMore Confidential NewsThe Other SideUni's toilet training to raise bathroom accuracyGemma Jones
