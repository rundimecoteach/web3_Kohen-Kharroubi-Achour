It claimed that the government is working on all aspects related to eradication of the disease from the region, and is completely mindful of the fact that there is still an urgent need for doing something out of the box in order to solve the matter and relieve people from their sufferings by curbing the dreadful influence of neurological conditions.While revealing his viewpoints regarding the issue, the Chairman of Neurological Alliance, Steve Ford, said that: “A crisis is looming but the government has its head in the sand”.»Real EstateArabtec and India's Raheja Developers signs dealDPG promotes comfortable livingmoreUS NewsGet Ready For Stock Market Collapse In 2012Is Daily Trend On Crude Oil About To Change!?Cable: Bearish Scenario For 2012 by Forexpros.comUsd/Chf: Bearish Waves Yet To ComeEur/Usd Headed Much Lower In 2012moreNew ZealandWarning on Heart Catheter, Inquest into Baby's Death HearsTB Outbreaks Call For Quarantining PatientsHealth Test Fraudsters Put Behind BarsEdible Chip Medicine in Britain by SeptemberMWS Is Irrelevant, Claims ReviewmoreLegal NewsCBI to file charge-sheet against Gali Janardhan ReddymoreSimilar entriesResearchers Link Cortex Size to Alzheimer'sNew Alzheimer’s Disease DrugTCE Could Escalate Risk of Parkinson's Disease, Says ReportGenetic link associated with Parkinson’s diseaseVitamin D Deficiency Identified at the Early Stage of Parkinson's disease, Claims StudyDubai NewsHP to make strong performance at GITEXDWTC Ensures Secure Network security and coverageZayed University students develops mobile telephone programDubai Metro ridership sets new record in September 2011Dubai Duty Free sales surges During SeptembermoreBanking SectorQueensland MP Bob Katter Presses For Lowering Interest RatesDubai's Sheikh Ahmed hopes better future of banking sectorUAE bank deposits slashes by Dh35bn in AugustmoreAbu Dhabi NewsNew cruise terminal launched at Abu DhabiJanet Jackson’s proves her mastery at Abu Dhabi ShowEtihad hopes to return to profit next yearJapan hopes positive response over oilfield renewalTechnogym steps in Abu DhabimoreSearchSearch this site:NavigationRecent postsFeed aggregatorUser loginLog in using OpenID:What is OpenID?Username: *Password: *Log in using OpenIDCancel OpenID loginCreate new accountRequest new passwordUS NewsGovernment Aims at Improving Mental Health ServicesRacecourse to Face Court over Cyclist’s DeathGeorgia Nurse Donates Kidney to Young PatientBe Careful With Headphones!
