RSSBit of exercise can stave off heart attackÂJust 30 minutes of activity a week can help a lot, study saysÂBy Sharon Kirkey, Postmedia NewsJanuary 11, 2012ÂTweetÂEven minimal amounts of physical activity lower the risk of a heart attack, a major Canadian-led worldwide study has found.As little as 30 minutes a week - an exercise dose well below guidelines recommending at least 30 minutes most days of the week - lowers the risk of a heart attack by about 30 per cent, according to the study of more than 24,000 men and women of all ages from 52 countries.The data show that "any level of physical activity during lei-sure time reduces the risk of heart attack," said first author Claes Held.According to an accompanying editorial: "Staying physically fit throughout life may well be one of the easiest, cheapest and most effective ways to avoid the coronary care unit."In another finding, owning both a car and TV was associated with a 27-per-cent higher risk of myocardial infarction, or MI, compared with people who own neither, though the finding was mainly seen in low-and middle-income countries.The new data, appearing this week in the European Heart Journal, come from the land-mark INTERHEART trial led by the Population Health Research Institute at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont. The original study identified the nine most important risk factors for heart attack, including smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes and abdominal fat.In the latest analysis, researchers looked at one of those nine risk factors in detail - physical inactivity.They compared the work and leisure time exercise habits of 10,043 people who had a first heart attack, with 14,217 people without a history of cardiovascular disease.The heart attack risk was lower for any level of exercise compared with the mainly sedentary, dropping by 13 per cent for mild activity (such as yoga, fishing or easy walking), and 24 per cent for moderate (walking, cycling) or strenuous activity (exercise that gets the heart beating rapidly, such as jogging, running or vigorous swimming.)When they looked at duration, 30 to 60 minutes of exercise a week - or less than 10 minutes per day when aver-aged out - was associated with a 28-per-cent lower risk of heart attack, a finding that held after researchers took age, sex, smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure and other known risk factors into account.And, in a "somewhat unexpected" finding, no further benefit was seen when exercise went beyond 60 minutes per week, the authors write.Held urged caution in interpreting the findings."We still think it's better to do 30, rather than 10 minutes a day," said Held, an associate professor at Uppsala University Hospital in Sweden, who carried out the research while doing post-doctoral work at McMaster."But it can be a comfort that even if you don't make the 30 minutes a day, it's still worth the effort to do less."People whose jobs involved either light or moderate physical activity were at a lower risk of heart attack than people with sedentary jobs who barely move at all.But heavy physical labour didn't lower the risk."You tend to think exercise is good for you regardless of what kind of exercise," said Held.But the heavy labour group "probably works in a fairly unhealthy environment. It can be very stressful, there can be high temperatures."Ample research has also shown that a heart attack can be unleashed by a sudden burst of exertion. Shovelling snow, for example, "is a well-known trigger for an MI," Held said.There's also substantial evidence linking the "psychosocial stress" of job strain - demanding jobs that give people little to no say in the work they do - with a higher risk of coronary heart disease, according to the editorial.Â© Copyright (c) The Vancouver SunÂÂÂE-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleShare this ArticleÂÂÂÂLocation refreshedÂStory ToolsÂE-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleÂFont:*****ÂImage:****ÂÂÂÂÂÂRelated TopicsCardiovascular MedicineHealth and FitnessHeart AttacksMost Popular NewsMost ReadE-mailedCommentedWhistler ski star Sarah Burke in coma after crash during trainingWhistler ski star Sarah Burke in induced coma after crashPolice identify female hiker's body found on Grouse MountainCanucks down Lightning in shootoutShaw Media plans to launch B.C.'s first all-day news channelNew Westminster councillor's daughter recalls park muggingÂmore Â»
