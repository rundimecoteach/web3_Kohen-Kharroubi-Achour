Compensation for the poultry farmers and owners of birds has also been announced by the Government.After receiving an advisory from the Centre in the afternoon, the Chief Minister’s Office gave its nod for culling to be carried out immediately and compensation distributed to the locals. District Collector of Khurda and Director of Veterinary Services have already been put on the job.Secretary to FARD Department Satyabrata Sahu said, sufficient numbers of protective masks and kits have already been placed for the teams which will carry out the culling. Over 50 teams have been readied for this purpose.As per the package, farmers will receive Rs 70 for each egg-laying bird, Rs 60 for a broiler, Rs 30 for a chick and Rs 2 for an egg. Similarly, for a kg of chicken feed, Rs 6 will be paid as compensation. The number of households and firms which will be come under the package will be known only after an initial assessment is made, Sahu said.The area, however, does not have many organised firms. There is one layer firm with a capacity of 40,000 birds which was started last year by a veterinary student with a Rs 2 cr loan. The mass killing could be disastrous for such firms.As the culling order came in, death of poultry birds was reported from Jagatsinghpur district. The teams of Directorate of Veterinary Services and Animal Diseases Research Institute went to Raghunathpur and Paradip after about 50 birds were reported dead.“Most of the birds belonged to firms and we have already collected samples which will be sent to the High Security Animal Diseases Laboratory at Bhopal,” sources added. More than 1000 samples have already been sent to the Bhopal lab most of which belonged to crows.(For updates you can share with your friends, follow IBNLive on Facebook, Twitter and Google+)Huge relief: Lioness back in captivitySuspended BJP leader queers pitch for jualMore on IBNLive Right NowTOP NEWSPak Prez Zardari leaves for Dubai amidst crisisImran Khan calls for early polls, won't back coupMOST SHAREDGoogle doodles Nicolas Steno's 374th birthdayPolice say Jarawa video old, Govt orders probeBhanwari Devi is dead: CBI tells Rajasthan HCPHOTOGALLERYVIDEOSPak Prez Zardari leaves for Dubai amidst crisisDhoni may retire from Tests by 2013Odisha Oppn for cancellation of land allotmentsWatch: All you wanted to know about homeopathyHit-and-run case: SC upholds Pereira's sentenceIndustrial production in Nov grows by 5.9 pcPakistan govt in a mess, Army coup fear looms largeMP govt to go ahead with Surya Namaskar showRajasthan: Khap Panchayat for education for girlsTrending Searches#Rahul Dravid#Madhuri Dixit#Dalai Lama#Hrithik Roshan#Surya Namaskara#Virender Sehwag#Mayawati#Sachin Tendulkar#Kannada language#Caroline Wozniacki#Surya Namaskara#Mayawati#Rahul Gandhi#Mamata Banerjee#Mullaperiyar Dam#Finance minister#Trinidad and Tobago#Parkash Singh Badal#Psychoactive drugHere's what brokerages make of Infosys Q3 earningsWhy did Infosys cut its FY12 dollar guidance?Infosys says business sentiment has worsened since NovInfy, RIL drag Sensex 138 pts down; IIP data non-eventHDFC Q3 PAT up 10% on lower investment incomeNov IIP at 5.9%, growth indicates RBI may not cut ratesSee Sensex at 18K by Dec-end; bet on IT: Deutsche EquitiesInflation could be manageable: PranabExpect IIP to pick up going forward: C RangarajanRBI cautions foreign banks on speculative forex tradesFollow IBNLive.comPolitics | India | Movies | IBN South | Cricket | Photos | Videos | Video Streams |World | Business | Sports | Blogs | Tech | Latest News | Talk | Citizen Journalist | Sitemap | Football | News | Books | Chat | Blaze | Apps | TV | Live TV | Time-Crunch TV | South India | India Global | Masand Review | Tennis | Golf | Formula One | Tech Toys | Documents | Newsletters | Health | Popular Tags : Topics | Team | Event | People | CityAbout Us | Disclaimer | Careers @ IBN | Contact Us | Feedback | Complaint Redressal | Advertise With Us | Connect.in.com | Live Stock Market News | India’s Premiere Technology Guide | Privacy Policy | IBNKhabar | RSS Feeds | Josh18 | Kids education and games site | Bigg Boss Season 5 | Firstpost | History India | Please tell us about your smart phone preference.. | Please tell us what you plan to buy your home this season.. | Please tell us about you mobile network.. | What is your dream car?
