Let’s not forget the equally inexplicable Krispy Kreme bread pudding, deep fried lasagna and deep fried stuffing on a stick.More related to this storyFast food breakfast?

My friends and I cook for regular families who worry about feeding their kids and paying the bills ... It wasn’t that long ago that I was struggling to feed my family, too.”(Feeding them luscious Twinkie Pie? Here’s hoping not.)New York Times columnist Frank Bruni jumped into the fray then too, dissing Mr. Bourdain for being an elitist culinary hypocrite who was serving up fatty duck confit as he assailed Ms. Deen’s monstrosities.“You can almost imagine Bourdain and Deen as political candidates, a blue-state paternalist squaring off against a red-state populist over correct living versus liberty in all its artery-clogging, self-destructive glory,” Mr. Bruni wrote.Foodie infighting aside, what place does tradition – be it of the Bible Belt or France – have when you’re serving up artery-clogging fare?43 commentsEmailTweetPrint/LicenseDecrease text sizeIncrease text sizeSponsored LinksLatest posts from The Hot ButtonJay-Z vows to clean up his lyrics following daughter's birthHush, little baby: Daycares begin to offer night careMen spend more money when women are scarce: studyYour cruise ship is sinking.
