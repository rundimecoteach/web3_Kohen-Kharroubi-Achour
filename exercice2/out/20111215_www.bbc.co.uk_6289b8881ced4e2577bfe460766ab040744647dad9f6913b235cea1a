Ratings will also be available online.The Welsh government launched a consultation into the food hygiene rating bill.Continue reading the main story“Start QuoteConsumers will vote with their feet.

The takeaway is now under new management not connected with the previous owner.Dr Prysor Williams from Bangor University said a compulsory scheme would force food businesses to "up their game"."There may be some resentment by businesses, by industry, but ultimately I think it is in their interests as well," said the lecturer in environmental management."It will help reward those businesses that are actually implementing good hygiene practises, because they will help draw more business."Consumers will vote with their feet. If these businesses are obliged to put up their score, and a score of zero is put on the door, then obviously you will choose to eat elsewhere."That will effectively force them to improve their game."A Consumer Focus Wales survey in October showed that 94% of people in Wales thought it should be compulsory for food businesses to display their food hygiene rating score.Consumer Focus Wales director Maria Battle said: "The consultation presents a great opportunity for the people of Wales to voice any concerns they have about food safety and to press the government to make further improvements."More on This StoryRelated StoriesTakeaway in E. coli probe reopens27 AUGUST 2011,
