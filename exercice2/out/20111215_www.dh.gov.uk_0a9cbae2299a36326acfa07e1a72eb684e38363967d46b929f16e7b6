The total investment in local NHS services for 2012-13 is £91.6 billion an increase of £2.5 billion or 2.8 per centIt includes:£87.5 billion in recurrent revenue allocations to PCTs including an additional £150 million for reablement (assistance regaining independence if daily living skills are lost through illness or injury), an increase of £2.5 billion£4.1 billion in allocations for primary dental services, pharmaceutical services, general ophthalmic services, and to support joint working between health and social care.Recurrent revenue allocationsRecurrent revenue allocations to PCTs are usually determined based on a weighted capitation formula. The weighted capitation formula determines each PCT’s available resources to enable them to commission similar levels of healthcare for populations with similar healthcare need, and to reduce avoidable health inequalities.To provide the NHS with financial stability in a year of transition, the weighted capitation formula has not been applied for 2012-13. All PCTs have received a uniform uplift in their 2012-13 recurrent allocations.Future allocationsSubject to the passing of the Health and Social Care Bill, for 2013-14 onwards, the NHS Commissioning Board will be responsible for the allocation of resources to clinical commissioning groups, while the Department of Health will make ring fenced grants to local authorities for their public health responsibilities.See table of actual allocations by PCT and exposition book 2012-13Read Sir David Nicholson’s allocations letterSee content on 2011-12 PCT allocationsShare:TweetInNews, NHS, Publications, Reports and publications|TaggedNHS allocations, PCTsComments are closed.Related contentWinners of Innovation in Outcomes competition announcedNext steps to deliver an all foundation trust provider landscapeProposed establishment of the NHS Trust Development Authority and Health Education EnglandHealth and Social Care Bill revised Impact Assessment publishedSupporting personal assistants working in adult social careSubscribeRSS LibraryEmail updatesConnect with DHContact DHRead our blogsFollow DH on TwitterWatch our videosSee our photosDH publicationsOrder onlineConsultationsBulletinsLatest publicationsResults of dentistry patient surveyNHS referral to treatment waiting times statistics – October 2011National Child Measurement Programme key findings publishedQuick A-ZAgeing wellAlistair BurnsAndrew LansleyAnne MiltonAntibiotic resistanceArm's length bodiesAutismBulletinsCampaignsCancerCarersChief Medical OfficerChief Professional OfficersChief Scientific OfficerChild weight managementConsultationsDementiaDeveloping wellDrugs, alcohol and tobaccoEnd of life careFreedom of InformationHealth visitorsHealthy StartImmunisationInfluenzaInnovationLeaflets, booklets and postersLearning disabilitiesLegislationLetters and circularsLiving wellLong term conditionsLord HoweManagement resourcesMedicines and pharmacyMental healthMinistersModernisationNational Quality BoardNewsNHSNHS financeNHS Pension SchemeNHS workforceNutritionObesityOffender healthOlder peoplePatient safetyPaul BurstowPayment by resultsPersonal health budgetsPhysical activityPolicy areasPregnancy and early yearsPrimary careProcurementPublic healthPublic Health Responsibility DealPublicationsQuality, innovation, productivity and preventionReports and publicationsResearch & developmentSexual healthSimon BurnsSocial careSocial care fundingSocial care reformSocial care workforceStarting wellStatisticsThe Green BookTransforming public healthUncategorisedUrgent and emergency careWorking wellTag cloudantibioticscancercaring for our futurechange4lifechief nursing officerchildrenclinical commissioning groupscommissioningdavid behanDavid NicholsondietdrugsfinanceflufundingGPshealth visitorsinfluenzainnovationlocal authoritiesMHRANational Institute for Health Researchnhs commissioning boardNHS Future ForumNHS managementNHS staffobesityorgan donationpatient safetyPbRPCT clustersPCTspensionsQIPPreference costsreferral to treatmentscreeningSHA clustersstrategysubstance misusetechnologyvaccinationswaiting timesworkforceyoung peoplePopular tags list - view accessible version of Tag cloud.Terms & conditions | Accessibility | Sitemap | Contact DH | FOI
