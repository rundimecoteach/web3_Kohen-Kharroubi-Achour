Workers were also more likely to drink alcohol if they had experienced a boring day.Boredom also affected working ability. Almost eight in 10 workers believed that they lost concentration if bored, while at least half said they made mistakes in their jobs if bored.The researchers from the University of Central Lancashire indicated that the main cause of boredom was 'an undemanding workload'."Managers should look at ways of reducing sources of workplace boredom and at encouraging healthier ways of coping. Reducing the sources of boredom could involve enrichment programmes such as job rotation, multi-skilling and empowerment. Encouraging healthier ways of coping could include education or providing healthy snacks and drinks in canteens," they suggested.Details of these findings were presented at the annual conference of the British Psychological Society's Division of Occupational Psychology in Chester.PrintEmailTo join the discussion, register by clicking hereQUICK LINKS:asthma | arthritis | psoriasis | crohn's | heart | epilepsy | eczema | osteoporosis | pregnancy | depression | alzheimer | cancer | anxiety | overweightAbout Irishhealth.com |
