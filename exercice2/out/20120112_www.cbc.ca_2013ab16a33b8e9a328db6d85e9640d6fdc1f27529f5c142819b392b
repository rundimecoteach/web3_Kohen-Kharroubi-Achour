That's a heart that races to more than 190 beats per minute. Pacemaker investigator Dr. Stuart Connolly and his co-authors wanted to see if silent but ast heart rates might explain some strokes.(Scott Gardner/Hamilton Spectator/Canadian Press)Dr. Jeff Healey and Dr. Stuart Connolly of McMaster University in Hamilton, and their co-authors were interested in exploring possible reasons for the quarter of strokes that currently have no known cause."This study suggests that silent atrial fibrillation is very common and may be the cause of many strokes that previously could not be explained," Healey said. "In all, atrial fibrillation may be responsible for nearly one in five strokes."In the study, participants in 23 countries who'd had a pacemaker implanted were followed for an average of 2 ½ years.In that time, 11 of the 261 patients or 4.2 per cent had a subclinical or silent atrial fibrillation detected by their pacemaker within three months and had an ischemic stroke or a serious heart complication called systematic embolism, the researchers found.The silent heart problem was also detected at least once during the follow-up time in nearly 35 per cent of people.Silent atrial tachyarrhythmias increased the risk of ischemic stroke or systematic embolism by 2.5 times, after taking into account other risk factors such as age, sex, previous strokes and history of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, Healey's team concluded.The study was funded by pacemaker manufacturer St. Jude's Medical. Several authors said they'd received fees from pacemaker and defibrillator makers.Share ToolsReport TypoSend FeedbackStay Connected with CBC NewsMobileFacebookPodcastsTwitterAlertsNewsletterBig Box AdvertisementTop News HeadlinesSyria protests continue against defiant AssadAnti-government protesters rallied for another night on the outskirts of Damascus, hours after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad made a surprise appearance at a pro-regime rally in the city centre, where he again vowed to end the months-long revolt against his rule.more »Afghan president condemns U.S. marines urination videoAfghan President Hamid Karzai condemns a video depicting what appears to be four U.S. marines urinating on the corpses of Taliban fighters, calling the apparent actions "completely inhumane" and demanding that the U.S. military punish the marines. more »RCMP spied on Bob Rae in 1960sNewly declassified documents reveal the RCMP spied on Bob Rae during his student activist days and likely amassed a personal file on the future interim Liberal leader. more »Haiti's struggle to build better homes after quakeInnovative building technology is one hope for the future in Haiti, where more than 500,000 people still live in temporary camps two years after a devastating earthquake. more »U.K. spies won't face charges for Guantanamo tortureAgents working for Britain's spy agencies won't face criminal charges over their alleged complicity in the mistreatment of former Guantanamo detainees, the country's top prosecutor says. more »More Headlines »Most RecentWatchListenShow previous slideShow next slideShow previous slideShow next slideLatest Health News HeadlinesFast heart detected by pacemakers tied to stroke riskAn irregular heartbeat that isn't felt but is detected by a pacemaker may point to an increased risk of stroke, a new study suggests. more »Bald Barbie idea gets Facebook supportThere's an online movement to develop a bald Barbie in support of children with cancer. more »Extra shifts may be needed to fix MRI backlogNewfoundland and Labrador's health minister says extra resources may need to be put towards lengthy wait times for potentially life-saving tests. more »Physical activity cuts heart attack rise globallyPhysical activity during both work and leisure time appears to significantly lower the risk of heart attack, whether a person lives in Canada or Colombia, research suggests. more »Naheed Nenshi ready to take on Rob Ford in fitness fightCalgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi says he is ready to take on Toronto Mayor Rob Ford in a battle of the bulge. more »FEATURED HEALTHCHASING CURESSpecial radio programCuring aging and obesityCHASING CURES Radio program part 2Curing the common cold and cancerTEEN HEALTHMedical report cardsStudents' blood pressure, cholesterol checkedCURING CANCERA reality checkAre we winning the war against cancer?Colds and virusesRespiratory illsDespite lots of sneezing, flu season still aheadHEALTH & FITNESSApp advicePicks from doctors and dietitiansCOLD INFECTIONA step-by-step look at the common coldHow does the mighty rhinovirus affect the body?Most ViewedMost CommentedShafia mom says teen's photos not a 'dishonour'Breastfeeding pics pulled from B.C. woman's FacebookAfghan president condemns U.S. marines urination videoMen found alive after truck crashes through iceRCMP officer charged with stealing cocaine in B.C.Many Canadians' retirement plans in dire need of reality checkRCMP spied on Bob Rae in 1960sPainter missing after fall from Ambassador BridgeOntario crash survivor crawled from burning planeBig Box AdvertisementShow previous slideDon't MissOBESITYSecret life of fat cellsHow couch potato monkeys shed weightMEDICAL DEVICESHip implantsWhen a cure is not a cureCOMMON COLDSymptom-free infectionScientist aims to boost immune responseTYPE 1 DIABETESVitamin D's linkCould a simple supplement be a game changer?DR.
