We will, however, wait for further development and clarity on how this is going to work in the hope that other families will never have to endure what we went through."- Edel O'ConnellIrish IndependentDownload our iPhone App NowComments that are judged to be defamatory, abusive or tasteless will not be approved and contributors who consistently fall below these criteria will be permanently blacklisted.
