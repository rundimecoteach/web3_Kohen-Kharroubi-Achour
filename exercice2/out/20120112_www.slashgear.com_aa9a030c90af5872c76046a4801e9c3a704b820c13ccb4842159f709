There are a number of health issues that come from being overweight and many of them can be lethal if not treated. One of the best treatments for the obese and the disorders that go with being overweight is exercise.The catch is that some are simply too ill to exercise. Researcher are now claiming that they have created a pill that is promised to give the person taking it the same benefits of exercise, without having to exercise. The hormone in the pill is being called irisin and occurs naturally in the body. According to the researchers, this hormone is found in normal muscle cells and triggers the calorie burning effects of exercise.Experts from Harvard Medical School believe that the new hormone could lead to treatments for obesity, diabetes, and possibly even cancer along with all sorts of other conditions that can benefit from exercise. So far, the medication has been testing in mice and in tests, the researchers found that glucose control improved and the mice lost small amounts of weight. It will be a long time yet before the medication hits the market.[via Telegraph]POPULAR STORIES TODAY:Sony shows off Crystal LED Display at CESCES 2012 Ultrabook Round-UpMotorola plans pared and polished Android range in 2012ASUS Transformer Prime 700 Series hands-onTags:medicine, research, ScienceSubscribe via RSS or Email | Read 517 timesMust Read Bits & BytesShowStopppers at CES 2012 Wrap-upRazer Project Fiona gaming tablet revealedSony outs 2nd-Gen Google TV boxes with streamlined remoteAT&T Nokia Lumia 900 LTE officialApple promises “Education Announcement” at Jan 19 eventMore Must Read Bits & Bytes »REVIEWSAndroid Ice Cream Sandwich reviewGalaxy Nexus ReviewiOS 5 ReviewiPhone 4S Review [Updated]AAXA P4 Pico Projector ReviewHP ENVY 15 ReviewPhilips goLITE BLU Energy Light ReviewThree WiFi Hub ZTE MF10 ReviewMore Reviews »ColumnsThe Problem With Pink Gadgets: Not Enough Of Them Philip BerneThe CES 2012 Crap Tablet Gush Begins Chris DaviesWhy Netflix Will Die If Yahoo!
