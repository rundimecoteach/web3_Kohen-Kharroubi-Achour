Since taking office in 2006, the federal bureaucracy had grown by some 33,000 jobs and federal spending has increased by $75-billion or 43 per cent. Now the government has determined it is time to cut back.Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz, who is responsible for the CFIA, said in an e-mail on Monday that “Canadian families can be assured that the safety of our food supply will not be affected as federal departments and agencies look for ways to be more efficient and more financially prudent with taxpayer’s dollars.”But neither Mr. Ritz nor his department could explain how food safety would remain unscathed by the loss of inspectors in meat processing plants.Malcolm Allen, the agriculture critic for the opposition New Democrats, said food safety should be spared when the government makes its cuts. “This is really irresponsible on the government’s part to really take a machete when they need to take a scalpel,” he said. “This is one group that in my view should have been left alone.”More related to this storyFood no safer than before tainted-meat scandal, union saysFlaherty won't take one-scythe-fits-all approach to 2012 budgetMcGuinty, Harper and the politics of spending cutsFlaherty’s tax credits cost Ottawa billionsConservatives push for deeper cuts to keep budget on trackUnion slams ‘absurd choice’ between balanced budget, public servicesFlaherty’s corporate-tax plan hits stumbling block in OntarioOttawa weighs sweeping review of tax systemDeeper cuts mean bigger bonuses, senior bureaucrats toldTories waste no time hitting brakes on spending, watchdog finds76 commentsEmailTweetPrint/LicenseDecrease text sizeIncrease text sizeToday's Must ReadsGlobe DriveDeals of the week: Always read the fine printSportsPlushenko vs. Chan: Get ready for a skating showdownGlobe InvestorIs now the time to lock in my mortgage?LifeJay-Z vows to clean up his lyrics following daughter's birthLifeIs Rob Ford’s weight-loss goal realistic?More from The Globe and MailNewsCharged with espionage, naval officer seeks delay in bail hearingReport On BusinessCarney sees consumer debt burdens growing even fatterNutritionHealthy Eating Jump-Start Day 12: Eat one vegetarian mealTechnologyWikipedia, Reddit going dark to protest anti-piracy billMOST POPULAR STORIESCaptain of doomed cruise ship pleaded not to reboardNarrowly spurned by Liberals, Sheila Copps throws in the towelIranian regime ‘frightens me,’ Harper saysCharged with espionage, naval officer seeks delay in bail hearingGallery: Cruise ship disasterBack to topMORE TOP STORIESNewsCaptain of doomed cruise ship pleaded not to reboardOpinionsThis month's editorial cartoonsSportsThree Canadians storm into 2nd round at Australian OpenGlobe DriveAverage age of vehicles in U.S. hits record 10.8 yearsTechnologyGoogle spends big on online privacy charm offensiveTechnologyHeads up: Pedestrians injured or killed while wearing headphones triplesPhotosTV: Five shows worth watching tonightBest pictures from the past 24 hoursVideoNJ mom gives birth on PATH TrainCalgary couple describes cruise ship ordealStep inside the Arthur, a tiny shop of vintage wondersYou dirty rats!
