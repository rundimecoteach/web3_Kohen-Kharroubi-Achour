| Comments: 0 (including replies)PrintEâmailReport ErrorCouncil's executive policy committee has voted in favour of giving the University of Manitoba a $10,000 grant to help relocate art from Winnipeg's old airport terminal.Winnipeg city administration initially recommended the grant not be approved since the U of M does not meet the regular criteria for a community incentive grant. A city report said the U of M is not a non-profit organization that offers sport or recreation activities or contributes to the health and well-being of the community.It will cost $110,000 to relocate Eli Bornstein's Structurist Relief in Fifteen Parts to the Max Bell Centre at the U of M's campus.St. Norbert Coun. Justin Swandel said the art is not his favourite piece, but there is an opportunity to keep part of the old airport's history alive. Transcona Coun. Russ Wyatt agreed, and said there is little difference between using the community grants to organizations to create murals, and helping relocate public art in the Max Bell Centre, a public facility.Executive policy committee recommended that the grant be approved, though Mayor Sam Katz and Couns. Paula Havixbeck (Charleswood-Tuxedo) and Scott Fielding (St. James) voted against the proposal.Havixbeck said $10,000 is a significant amount of money and she can't support it given that it will be a difficult budget year and there are talks of a potential tax increase.EPC also approved a plan to review the criteria for community incentive grants.PrintEâmailReport ErrorYou can comment on most stories on winnipegfreepress.com.
