GiftsHospital mistakenly bills patients for millionsAssociated Press,
Updated: January 17, 2012 10:55 ISTNew York: Patients at a New York City hospital are getting billed for tens of millions of dollars because of a computer error.Unemployed doorman Alexis Rodriguez says he almost became ill when he received a $44.8 million bill from the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center.Rodriguez tells the New York Daily News (http://nydn.us/AjolYU )that he was hospitalized last spring with pneumonia and was afraid the bill was legit.Turns out the company that prepares the bills had mistakenly put the invoice number in the space where the invoice amount should go.The billing company is telling patients to ignore the multimillion-dollar bills. It says it will send out corrected ones.The hospital didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday, which is a holiday.For NDTV Updates, follow us on Twitter or join us on FacebookStory first published:January 17, 2012 10:53 ISTTags:hospital bill error, hospital bill in millionsCommentsCommentsAdvertisementAdvertisementFeatured ServicesBuy 'RAFA'Featured Car: Jaguar XKBuy Samsung Galaxy S2Buy/Rent/Sell PropertyLooking for restaurants?Home loans todayKaty Perry-Download MusicGo GoaBest Deals on OmegaPropertyPropertyTravelTravelLocal SearchLocal SearchFindInVideoLive TVPak PM will not resign: Rehman Malik5:56Aamchi Oprah: The big O in Mumbai5 VideosWe have let the nation down: Gambhir1:32ईशा से मार्च में शादी करेंगे जहीर1:18More »PhotosDay before birthday, Kate dazzles in laceFriends, family at Farhan's birthday bashLook who attended the Umang 2012 showMore »NDTV SocialBecome friends with your favourite NDTV people and shows.
