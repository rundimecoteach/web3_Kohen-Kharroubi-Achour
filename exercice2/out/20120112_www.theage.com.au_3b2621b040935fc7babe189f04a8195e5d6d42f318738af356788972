They wanted to know whether folate - the naturally occurring version of folic acid - could help reduce levels of depression.''Folate had no effect on whether people were more or less depressed,'' said one of the study's authors, Helen Christensen, professor of Mental Health Research at the University of New South Wales.Advertisement: Story continues belowHowever, there was an effect on cognitive decline.''We found that those people who were taking folate did not seem to show the same level of cognitive change as those that were not taking folate,'' she said.Professor Christensen said using folate and Vitamin B12 was an inexpensive way for people to improve memory function.''I didn't expect that such a small dose of folate supplement would have such an effect on cognitive levels,'' she said.Join the conversation3 people are reading this now.TweetTop National articlesTax breaks for wealthy under fireADF hit by new sex abuse claimsTeachers jump off the fast trackHouse prices 'slump' in basin townsCancer drug shortageMore National articlesStory ToolsShare on FacebookEmail this storyPrint this storyThe Age JobsAdvertisementLatest VideoNational News Video More videoClick to play videoIs tagging becoming an extreme sport?A teenage boy has died after being hit by a train in Sydney's inner west.
