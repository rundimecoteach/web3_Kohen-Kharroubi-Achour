The agency also doesn’t regulate auditors farms hire to certify that their operations comply with good safety practices.While the panel report makes no specific recommendations, “reforms in third party audits are essential,” committee Democrats wrote in a letter today to the FDA. Auditors are hired by grocers, processors and others to ensure best practices are used to ensure food is safe.“Weakness in third-party auditors represent a significant gap in the food-safety system because the auditors are often the only entities to inspect a farm or facility,” according to the letter, signed by Representative Henry Waxman of California, the committee’s senior Democrat, and three other lawmakers.‘Superior’ RatingJensen Farms was graded by an independent auditor as having “superior” safety practices just one month before consumers became ill from eating the fruit.Representatives of Jensen Farms didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world’s largest retailer, is among grocers facing lawsuits claiming they sold contaminated cantaloupe. Costco Wholesale Corp. is developing new safety protocols as a result. The outbreak occurred in September and October.“It’s unfortunate that victims and their families weren’t involved in the congressional committee’s investigation,” said Bill Marler, a Seattle-based food safety lawyer who represents clients in the Jensen Farms case, in an interview.“There’s really nothing new that’s added,” said Marler, referring to the report. “It’s basically what the FDA already found.”Widespread contamination and unsanitary practices were found at a packing facility owned by the company, the FDA said in an Oct. 18 warning letter.“FDA officials stated that the outbreak could likely have been prevented if Jensen Farms had maintained its facilities in accordance with exiting FDA guidance,” according to the House panel’s report.The letter to the FDA calling for audit oversight was also signed by Diana DeGette of Colorado, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey and John Dingell of Michigan.--Editors: Adriel Bettelheim, Andrew PollackTo contact the reporter on this story: Stephanie Armour in Washington at sarmour@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Adriel Bettelheim at abettelheim@bloomberg.netBusiness ExchangeE-mailPrintREADER DISCUSSIONSponsored LinksBuy a link now!Most Popular ContentReadE-mailedDiscussedSlide ShowsThree Types of People to Fire ImmediatelyTop B-School Stories of 2011Lego Is for GirlsTransocean: No Apologies Over Gulf Oil SpillIt's Always Sunny in Silicon ValleyRSS Feed: Most Read StoriesThree Types of People to Fire ImmediatelyWhich Is America's Best City?Lego Is for GirlsTop B-School Stories of 2011Professional Women and a Secure RetirementRSS Feed: Most E-mailed StoriesKorea's Next Challenge: Global CompetitivenessRSS Feed: Most Discussed StoriesThe 20 Biggest Casinos2006 Best Global BrandsOlympic ArchitectureBest Young Tech Entrepreneurs 2009Fuqua Virtual TourRSS Feed: Most Popular Slide ShowsMore in BusinessweekSlide Show2012 Range Rover EvoqueSpecial ReportCEO Guide to 3-D PrintingVideoPrivate Equity Firms Create Jobs, Rogers SaysSlide ShowTen Products Printed in 3DSpecial ReportFocus On Entrepreneurs, November 2011Video1/10: The Start of CES, Detroit Auto ShowPost a JobJobsBusiness Development jobsDesign jobsEntertainment jobsEnvironmental jobsExecutive jobsHealthcare jobsLegal jobsManagement jobsMarketing jobsReal Estate jobsRetail jobsSales jobsView all jobsSimplyHiredRelated topics inSustainable Business PracticesWorkplace SafetyFood SafetyTransportation SafetyMarketing to LatinosPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.Special ReportsFix This/TransportationCrisis in JapanHealth CareSentiment AnalysisMore Special ReportsBusiness ToolsB-School ComparisonB-School CalendarBW for MobileE-mail NewslettersRSSWhite PapersA-Z IndexBW AuthorsBX TopicsPrivate CompaniesPublic CompaniesLists & RankingsBest Global BrandsBest Places to Launch a CareerBest Providers of Customer ServiceBest Undergraduate Business SchoolsBusiness School Rankings & ProfilesBW 50: Best Performing CompaniesTop 100 IT CompaniesMost Innovative CompaniesFollow Us@BW on TwitterBW on FacebookBlogsEconoChatEuroCrisisJoshua Green on PoliticsOccupy Wall StreetSmall BusinessTechnology[+] Rate this pageSlideshow GalleryAutosBusiness SchoolsDesignInternationalInnovationInvestingManagingPolicyReal EstateSmall BusinessTechnologyMagazineCurrent IssueSubscribe NowBloombergAboutAdvertisingCustom PublishingEDGE ProgramsReprintsTerms of UseDisclaimerPrivacy NoticeEthics CodeContact UsSite Map©2012 Bloomberg L.P.
