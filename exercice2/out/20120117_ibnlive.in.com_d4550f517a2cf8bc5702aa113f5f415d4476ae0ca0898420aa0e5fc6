In a total of 81 of the 116 collisions, 70 per cent led to person's death. In a quarter of the cases a warning such as a horn or siren was sounded before the crash.Two out of three victims were men and under the age of 30, with around one in ten of all cases under the age of 18. Nine out of ten cases occurred in urban areas and more than half of the victims were struck by trains.(For updates you can share with your friends, follow IBNLive on Facebook, Twitter and Google+)#Headphones#ResearchesShammi Kapoor's Twitter account hackedNokia ready to support LTE technology in IndiaExisting Member LoginUsernamePasswordRemember my password on this computerNot a member yet?Thank you.
