Donna Bowater11:48AM GMT 15 Dec 2011One in four women have only ever had one sexual partner, compared with 17 per
cent of men, according to the Health Survey for England.The results suggest Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who once claimed to have
slept with "no more than 30 women", may have fared better than
three men with average romantic conquests.The data, published by the NHS Information Centre, showed 27 per cent of men
claimed the number of their partners had reached double figures while just
13 per cent of women said they had had 10 or more partners of the opposite
sex.The report also showed a continuing trend of a growing number of girls first
having sex under the age of 16More than one in four women aged 16 to 24 first had sex under the age of
consent compared with more than one in five men.Related ArticlesMiddle-aged women 'more sexually active'29 Jul 2010Viagra rationing to limit sex lives07 Dec 2011Men think of sex 19 times a day29 Nov 2011Among 55 to 69-year-olds, the figure was much lower with only 15 per cent of
