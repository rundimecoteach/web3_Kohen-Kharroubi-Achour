The increased mobility of health professionals in the EU has highlighted huge variations both in the practical abilities of professionals of similar grades, and in the systems set up to ensure quality, in different member states."In response, the Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said: "We agree that for too long patients have been let down by European rules which allowed doctors to operate in the UK without the necessary safeguards. That's why I announced last year new rules on checking doctors' language skills and new powers to take action against doctors who can't speak English properly."He added: "We want to revise the [European working time directive] to give the NHS the flexibility it needs on training. Our overriding concern must be to protect patients."COMMENTSCOMMENTNAMEEMAIL (NOT DISPLAYED)TOWN / COUNTRY / ORGANISATIONYOUR COMMENT WILL BE APPROVED BY A MODERATORHTML CODE IS NOT PERMITTED.RELATED NEWS »Huge variations in patients' meal costsImplant scandal ''shows future of NHS''Keogh review to look at cosmetic surgeryHiggins to chair NHS Litigation AuthorityLansley to increase NHS litigation fundHealth minister defends NHS 111 missed callsFURTHER INFORMATIONNews feedHealth and social care feedRegister for weekly bulletinsPublic Service Review: HealthPublic ServantSUGGESTED FEATURES »Greening the NHS fleetImprovements in cancer researchBad things happen in hospitalsPersonal budgets: flexibility helps to bridge the divideEarly intervention: the key to reformHealth reform – the government's albatross?RELATED LINKSCommunity and healthEuropeAndrew LansleyABOUT USCONTACTSSITE MAPTESTIMONIALSLINKSADVERTISECAREER VACANCIESTERMS & CONDITIONSCOPYRIGHTPUBLIC SERVICE PUBLICATIONSGOVERNMENT NEWSPUBLIC SERVICE EVENTSPUBLIC SERVICE JOB SEARCHDATA SOLUTIONSYOUR SAYpublicservice.co.uk Ltd, Ebenezer House, Ryecroft, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire ST5 2UB
